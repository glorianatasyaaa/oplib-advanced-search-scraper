In the homogeneous cache, the content store capacity is the same for all nodes in the network, and heterogeneous is the opposite condition. Heterogeneous scheme with higher capacity in core network provides the better cache hit ratio and delay for all of scenarios.

            "Purpose: Despite the practice of credit card services by Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) is debatable, Islamic banks (IBs) have been offering this product. Both Muslim and non-Muslim customers have subscribed to the products. Thus, it is critical to analyse the strategy of IBs\u2019 moral messages in reminding their Muslim and non-Muslim customers to repay their credit card debts. This paper aims to investigate this issue in Indonesia using data mining via machine learning. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study examines the IBs\u2019 customers across the 32 provinces of Indonesia regarding their moral status in credit card debt repayment. This work considers 6,979 observations of the variables that affect the moral status of the IBs\u2019 customers in repaying their debt. The five types of data mining via machine learning (i.e. Boruta, logistic regression, Bayesian regression, random forest, XGBoost and spatial cluster) are used. Boruta, random forest and XGBoost are used to select the important features to investigate the moral aspects. Bayesian regression is used to get the odds and opportunity for the transition of each variable and spatially formed based on the information from the logistical intercepts. The best method is selected based on the highest accuracy value to deliver the information on the relationship between moral status categories in the selected 32 provinces in Indonesia. Findings: A different variable on moral status in each province is found. The XGBoost finds an accuracy value of 93.42%, which the three provincial groups have the same information based on the importance of the variables. The strategy of IBs\u2019 moral messages by sending the verse of al-Qur\u2019an and al-Hadith (traditions or sayings of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH) and simple messages reminders do not impact the customers\u2019 repaying their debts. Both Muslim and non-Muslim groups are primarily found in the non-moral group. Research limitations\/implications: This study does not consider socio-economic demographics and culture. This limitation calls future works to consider such factors when conducting a similar topic. Practical implications: The industry professionals can take benefit from this study to understand the Indonesian customers\u2019 moral status in repaying credit card debt. In addition, future works may advance the recent findings by considering socio-cultural factors to investigate the moral status approach to Islamic credit warnings that is not covered by this study. Social implications: This work finds that religious text of credit card repayment reminders sent to Muslims in several provinces of Indonesia does not affect their decision to repay their debts. To some extent, this finding draws a social issue that the local IBs need to consider when implementing the strategy of credit card repayment reminders. Originality\/value: This study credits a novelty in the discourse of data science for Islamic finance practices. Specifically, this study pioneers an example of using data mining to investigate Islamic-moral incentives in credit card debt repayment. \u00a9 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

This is certainly not suitable for new users and users who are new to music. In addition, most of the research related to music recommendation systems focuses on accuracy and pays less attention to user experience. This can be overcome by using an explanation facility which is the reason the system provides recommendations. Explanation facility is able to improve user experience in several factors such as Transparency, Scrutability, Trustworthiness, Effectiveness, Persuasiveness, Efficiency, and Satisfaction. Therefore, in this study, we develop a conversational recommender system with an explanation facility in the music domain. This system works by conducting a conversation between the system and the user, by a chatbot. This system is a knowledge-based recommender system and uses an ontology that serves as a knowledge base for recommending music. We evaluate the system based on two parameters, such as recommendation accuracy and also the influence of explanation for user satisfaction. Tests show that a system with an explanation facility increases user experience more than a system without an explanation facility. In addition, system testing also shows high accuracy (90.48%) and successfully meets user needs.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

            "Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a medical imaging technique used to detect pathology that occurs in the macula. The manual analysis process tends to be less effective and efficient both in time and diagnostic accuracy. This study proposes an automatic classification system for generalized macular retinal pathology based on OCT retinal images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with EfficientNet architecture. In the preprocessing stage, three types of signal processing are analyzed on the image, namely Gaussian Filter, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and Gabor Filter. This paper also evaluates two different optimizers, namely Adaptive Moment (Adam) and Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD). The EfficientNet model works using a combined scaling method to balance all network dimensions.

            "Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a medical imaging technique used to detect pathology that occurs in the macula. The manual analysis process tends to be less effective and efficient both in time and diagnostic accuracy. This study proposes an automatic classification system for generalized macular retinal pathology based on OCT retinal images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with EfficientNet architecture. In the preprocessing stage, three types of signal processing are analyzed on the image, namely Gaussian Filter, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and Gabor Filter. This paper also evaluates two different optimizers, namely Adaptive Moment (Adam) and Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD). The EfficientNet model works using a combined scaling method to balance all network dimensions. The experimental results show that the proposed model's preprocessing CLAHE and Adam's optimization function can classify four standard retinal macular pathology classes.

            "This paper proposes an evolutionary Rao algorithm (ERA) to enhance three state-of-the-art metaheuristic Rao algorithms (Rao-1, Rao-2, Rao-3) by introducing two new schemes. Firstly, the population is split into two sub-populations based on their qualities: high and low, with a particular portion. The high-quality sub-population searches for an optimum solution in an exploitative manner using a movement scheme used in the Rao-3 algorithm. Meanwhile, the low-quality one does in an explorative fashion using a new random walk. Secondly, two evolutionary operators: crossover and mutation, are incorporated to provide both exploitation and exploration strategies. A fitness-based adaptation is introduced to dynamically tune the three parameters: the portion of high-quality individuals, mutation radius, and mutation rate throughout the evolution, based on the improvement of best-so-far fitness. In contrast, the crossover is implemented using a standard random scheme. Comprehensive examinations using 38 benchmarks: twenty-three classic functions, ten CEC-C06 2019 benchmarks, and five global trajectory optimization problems show that the proposed ERA generally outperforms the four competitors: Rao-1, Rao-2, Rao-3, and firefly algorithm with courtship learning (FA-CL). Detailed investigations indicate that both proposed schemes work very well to make ERA evolves in an exploitative manner, which is created by a high portion of high-quality individuals and the crossover operator, and avoids being trapped on the local optimum solutions in an explorative manner, which is generated by a high portion of low-quality individuals and the mutation operator. Finally, the adaptation scheme effectively controls the exploitation-exploration balance by dynamically tuning the portion, mutation radius, and mutation rate throughout the evolution process. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.",

For citrus plant cultivators, it is crucial to recognize the problem early so that it does not interfere with citrus plant growth or even prevent citrus plant death. Creating a computer-based application that automatically recognizes citrus plant diseases will be more manageable for farmers to eradicate immediately. In this paper, a recognition model of citrus plant diseases is developed using a CNN to classify the disease of citrus leave images into four classes: Blackspot, Cancer, Greening, and Healthy. This dataset was obtained from the Kaggle website. An evaluation using the 5-fold crossvalidation for a dataset of 600 image data of citrus leaves shows that the developed model gives an accuracy of 95,6%.

            "Generating process models that reflect close behavioral resemblance to the actual process Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in process mining can be challenging without taking the four quality criteria of process discovery into account. The four quality criteria, i.e. fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity, should be well balanced in order to produce proper process models which are aligned to the real-life executions. This paper proposes a method to optimize process discovery quality criteria (PDQC) by implementing different thresholds and analyzing calculation results using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Infrequent Inductive Miner algorithm. This paper sets up two experiments with different scenarios to measure the calculations of quality criteria and the quality of generated models. The experiments compare two SOPs to the process models discovered by Infrequent Inductive Miner algorithm; hence the SOPs serve as references to determine the generated models quality. The purpose of applying two different scenarios in the experiments is to discover how well the Infrequent Inductive Miner thresholds can produce predictive models under these two different scenarios circumstances. This paper has been successful in predicting the best-fit model in reference to the SOPs by optimizing the four quality criteria of process discovery using ROC thresholds settings and by using infrequent inductive miner algorithm for models generation, and also in improving the accuracy of models measurements. The accuracy rate of the prediction model from Experiment 1 is 83%, while Experiment 2 yields an accuracy rate of 88%.

Besides location, student\u2019s academic performance and economic level are also concerned.

Many studies have proven that this model can generate music with a consistent structure, but the pieces that are generated still lack emotion in it. In this paper, we extend Transformer-based model capabilities to generate music with controllable emotion. The emotion is divided into three categories: negative, neutral, and positive. We train the model using 120 MIDI files from our new piano datasets. The dataset has been labeled based on their emotion. The labeling is done manually by hearing. The total MIDI files available in the dataset is 210 but we filter it so that only 120 remains. We also add a new token to represent emotion on REvamped MIDI-derived event (REMI). The experimental results show that human subject agreed that Transformer-XL model using REMI and emotion token is able to generate emotion-based music. We also compare our generated pieces with other datasets. The result show that the majority of respondents prefer pieces that are generated using our datasets. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

It is different from most existing university course timetabling models where the environment is physical, and the system can dictate the timeslots and classrooms for the students and lecturers. The courses are delivered online in this model, so physical classrooms are no longer required, as was the case in most previous course timetabling studies. In this model, the matching process is conducted based on the assigned timeslots and the requested courses. The courses are elective rather than mandatory. Three metaheuristic methods are used to optimize this model: artificial bee colonies, cloud theory-based simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Due to the simulation process, the cloud theory-based simulated annealing performs best in minimizing the number of unserved requests. This method outperforms the two other metaheuristic methods, the genetic algorithm, and the artificial bee colony algorithm. According to the simulation results, when the number of students is low, the cloud theory-based simulated annealing has 91 percent fewer unserved requests than the genetic algorithm. When the number of students is large, this figure drops to 62%. \u00a9 2021",

This research aims to deploy a 5G New Radio (NR) network in Indonesia with a frequency spectrum of 3.5 GHz due to its widely used globally, wherein this research selects an urban area, Bandung city, with an area of 167.31 km2 from the year 2021 to 2026. Bandung city is selected because it is one of the big cities implementing 5G based on the KOMINFO strategic plan. This research uses a planning approach based on capacity and coverage. The capacity planning approach determines the users' projection, demand traffic, and data rates for determining the number of gNodeB. While the coverage planning uses uplink and downlink scenarios from Outdoor to Outdoor (O2O) with Line of Sight (LOS) conditions based on the 3GPP 38.901 UMa (Urban Macro) propagation model.

            "The majority of music recommendation systems use user data such as ratings, likes, feedback, music played as the user model. This is certainly not suitable for new users and users who are new to music. In addition, most of the research related to music recommendation systems focuses on accuracy and pays less attention to user experience. This can be overcome by using an explanation facility which is the reason the system provides recommendations. Explanation facility is able to improve user experience in several factors such as Transparency, Scrutability, Trustworthiness, Effectiveness, Persuasiveness, Efficiency, and Satisfaction. Therefore, in this study, we develop a conversational recommender system with an explanation facility in the music domain. This system works by conducting a conversation between the system and the user, by a chatbot. This system is a knowledge-based recommender system and uses an ontology that serves as a knowledge base for recommending music. We evaluate the system based on two parameters, such as recommendation accuracy and also the influence of explanation for user satisfaction. Tests show that a system with an explanation facility increases user experience more than a system without an explanation facility. In addition, system testing also shows high accuracy (90.48%) and successfully meets user needs.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

            "In a virus outbreak that attacks human respiration, there is an increase in the need for ventilators that is not proportional to their availability. A ventilator is a device that serves to assist or replace normal ventilation functions in people who have respiratory problems. The lungs are important organs in the respiratory system. The lungs can inflate if the atmospheric pressure is greater than the lung pressure (Palv). Conversely, the lungs can deflate if the atmospheric pressure is less than Palv. In the process of inspiration, air flows from outside to the alveoli, increasing oxygen levels. The faster oxygen is introduced into the alveoli from the atmosphere, the higher the oxygen concentration in the alveoli. So that the oxygen concentration in the alveoli is controlled by the speed with which new oxygen enters the lungs through the ventilation process. In people who have respiratory problems, the body is less able to supply the oxygen needs of the lungs so that the flow of air pressure that flows into the lungs must be controlled. A ventilator is made with the principle of pressure difference. Atmospheric pressure is set greater than Palv so that air enters the lungs. In contrast, atmospheric pressure is set to be less than Palv to force air out of the lungs. The outside air pressure can be increased by providing positive pressure air from the airflow drive device. With the Fuzzy Logic control method, the speed of the airflow drive device is adjusted to meet the patient's needs. Ventilators that have been designed and manufactured can provide air pressure in the pressure range of 0 to +50 cmH2O or the equivalent of 0 to 0.711167 psi. The basic pressure at the end of the breath is set to be equal to atmospheric pressure.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

The case study of providing electricity for public street lighting using PV system for remote area in Indonesia was conducted. First, the size of PV system was estimated based on the daily electricity consumption and the peak solar hour (PSH) on the site location of the project, so the requirements of the components were obtained. Second, the components selection was performed by surveying the information from the components manufacturers which met with the requirement of the system. Third, economic analysis was performed by considering the capital cost and the final specific energy electric cost. The public street lighting used 80 W lamp and was operated for 12 hours per day. The result showed that the total capital cost for the system was 8,031,400 IDR (551 USD) and the final specific energy cost at 1,960 IDR\/kWh (0.13 USD\/kWh).

Referring to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there are 3 types of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive impulsivity, and combination. The symptoms of ADHD appear before 12 years of age and last at least 6 months. Therefore, the role of parents is crucial to find out the presence of ADHD in children. The role of parents is significant in determining the presence of ADHD in children because 83.5% of children have a history of undiagnosed ADHD.

Moreover, in decision making, the CBR method looks for similarities to previous cases where there are many case data so that the level of similarity is high.

Moreover, in decision making, the CBR method looks for similarities to previous cases where there are many case data so that the level of similarity is high. In addition, the certainty factor can strengthen confidence and certainty so that the results are accurate. Referring to the system created and the results of the tests that have been carried out, the accuracy value is 100%  \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

The land slope is thought to affect the absorption of nutrients, which have implications on yields. This study aimed to explore the interaction between the pruning year and land slopes in nutrients uptake in tea plantations and to obtain the correlation between soil fertility and nutrients content in tea plants at different land slopes. A field experiment was carried out from December 2020 to February 2021 at The Research Centre for Tea and Cinchona, Gambung. A Split Plot design was conducted to observe between pruning year (PY) that consisted of pruning year 1 (PY-1), pruning year 2 (PY-2), pruning year 3 (PY-3) and pruning year 4 (PY-4) with two different slopes in each block that consisted of flat land (slope = 0-8%) and sloping land (slope = 15%-25%). Results of the study showed that there was no interaction between PY and slope on the uptake and nutrient content in the tea plant, but there was an independent effect from each factor, where the PY factor affected all nutrients uptake, while the slope factor only affected P content. There was no significant difference between flat and sloping land on soil nutrients, but there was a correlation between plant nutrients and tea plant nutrient content. P content had a strong correlation with K content (r = 0.657); and K content had a strong correlation with Mg content (r = 0.891). Copyright \u00a9 by the Author(s), 2021",

However, the use of digital media in EPR raises concerns about the authenticity and security aspects of patient data. The authenticity of medical images is one of the important data and must be considered. One way that can be done to minimize the possibility of various threats is to use a watermark. Another problem that arises is the size of the medical image. This study proposes a watermarking system for medical images using the Compressive Sensing method based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which can be used to reduce the size of medical images. Compressive Sensing includes lossless compression which is a way to compress the size of a data without losing the original information. The medical image watermarking process is divided into two processes, namely the insertion process and the extraction process. The insertion process is carried out using the Spread Spectrum method with a Gaussian distributed PN code key, resulting in a watermarked image. While the extraction process is carried out by reconstructing the image using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) method, SVD reconstruction.

On the other hand, fuel costs optimization is quite challenging. Under certain conditions, e.g., at the lowest load, generating capacity can exceed the demand when all the generators are operated. Thus, some generators should be turned off in order to minimize fuel costs. In this case, unit commitment is one of the interesting issues to be studied. It can reduce fuel costs and transmission losses in accordance with the generator power composition and location. This paper proposes a method that considers unit commitment in the optimization processes quickly and accurately. It will be considered in determining generator scheduling. The optimization process starts with the temporary results based on the direct method. The temporary results will determine whether the generator is on or off by considering the generator limits. At the same time, transmission losses will be evaluated with the B-Loss Matrix once the final results are obtained. This method has been tested with 26 buses and six generators with satisfactory results. Although the transmission losses have increased by 122.8% (i.e., increase of 64.422 MW, from 281.739 MW to 346.161 MW) compared to the results without unit commitment, the fuel costs have fallen to 85.24% (i.e., from $417,996.5 to $356,294.2) of all the generators stated commit. \u00a9 2021 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.",

In this paper, the measurement process is proposed through 2 stages, namely: stage 1 conducting an E-Readiness survey and assessment of the maturity level of ICT based on COBIT 5, and stage 2 looking for the correlation value between the data from the E-Readiness survey and ICT maturity level data. Measurements were carried out at DISKOMINFO Majalengka District as a representative of government units. The results of the E-Readiness survey stated that the readiness level reached 45% and the ICT maturity level reached 2.86 (managed level). Overall DISKOMINFO has shortcomings in various aspects assessed through the COBIT 5 standard. Meanwhile, based on the Pearson Correlation, a correlation value of 0.92 is obtained.

            "Background: One of the vital organs that require regular check is heart. The representation of heart health can be identified through electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Monitoring the heart condition needs to be regularly done to prevent heart attack that can occur suddenly and very quickly particularly for someone who has had a heart attack before. Nevertheless, it raises the problem of cost, time efficient, and flexibility. It takes a high cost and much time to perform this examination. A vital signal monitoring device is needed with low cost, wearable, accurate, and simple in use. Methods: This research designs and develops a device and application for monitoring human vital signals including ECG, SpO2, BP, and heart rate. A multi-sensor system with a control unit was applied to the device which was then called the Armband Vital Sign Monitor. This device can be used to measure vital parameters simultaneously using multiplexing techniques programmed in the microcontroller. Armband vital sign monitor is also equipped with Bluetooth module as a communication media for further data processing and display. Results: Armband vital sign monitor produces >99% accuracy in body temperature measurements, \u00b12 deviation values in SpO2 measurements, and systolic and diastolic deviations at \u00b13-8 mmHg.

            "Semantic segmentation has become one of the trending topics in the world of computer vision and deep learning. Recently, due to an increasing demand to solve a semantic segmentation task simultaneously with attribute recognition of objects, a new task named attribute-aware semantic segmentation has been introduced. Since the task requires to handle pixel-wise object class estimation with its attributes such as a pedestrian's body orientation, previous works had difficulties to handle ambiguous attributes such as body orientations in object-level, especially when segmenting the pedestrians with their attributes correctly. This paper proposes the ColAtt-Net that is an attribute-aware semantic segmentation model augmented by a column-wise mask branch to predict the pedestrians' orientations in the horizontal perspective of the input image. We firmly assume that the pedestrians captured by a car-mounted camera are distributed horizontally so that for each column of the input image, the pedestrian pixels can be labeled with one orientation uniformly. In the proposed method, we split the output of the base semantic segmentation model into two branches; one branch for segmenting the object categories, while the other one, as the novel column-wise attribute branch, is to map the recognition of pedestrian's orientations that are distributed horizontally. This method successfully enhances the performance of attribute-aware semantic segmentation by reducing the ambiguity on segmenting the pedestrian's orientation. Improvements on the pedestrian orientation segmentation are confidently shown by the proposed method in the experimental results, both in quantitative and qualitative views.

The proposed wearable reflector, which is meant for wireless communications, comprises 3x3 AMC unit cells. Each unit cell comprises a square patch and a square ring patch with gaps placed in a concentrically organized pattern. An RT\/Duroid\u00ae RO3003 dielectric substrate with a thickness of 0.5 mm is employed for the design and implementation. Meanwhile, a printed dipole antenna as an inseparable part of the wearable reflector is also deployed on the same dielectric substrate. This configuration, i.e., a printed dipole antenna and a wearable reflector, is expectable to operate at two different frequency bands or dual-band, covering the required frequencies of wireless communications while maintaining its compact size and simple configuration. Experimental characterization is applied to validate the proposed design, in which the results demonstrate the ability of configuration to work at two frequency responses, namely 2.45 GHz band, and 3.35 GHz band. \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

            "Entropy regularized optimal transport (EOT) distance and its symmetric normalization, known as the Sinkhorn divergence, offer smooth and continuous metrized weak-convergence distance metrics. They have excellent geometric properties and are useful to compare probability distributions in some generative adversarial network (GAN) models. Computing them using the original Sinkhorn matrix scaling algorithm is still expensive. The running time is quadratic at O(n2) in the size n of the training dataset. This work investigates the problem of accelerating the GAN training when Sinkhorn divergence is used as a minimax objective. Let G be a Gaussian map from the ground space onto the positive orthant \u211dr+with r < n. To speed up the divergence computation, we propose the use of c(x, y) = -\u03b5 log \u3008G(x), G(y)\u3009 as the ground cost.

            "Entropy regularized optimal transport (EOT) distance and its symmetric normalization, known as the Sinkhorn divergence, offer smooth and continuous metrized weak-convergence distance metrics. They have excellent geometric properties and are useful to compare probability distributions in some generative adversarial network (GAN) models. Computing them using the original Sinkhorn matrix scaling algorithm is still expensive. The running time is quadratic at O(n2) in the size n of the training dataset. This work investigates the problem of accelerating the GAN training when Sinkhorn divergence is used as a minimax objective. Let G be a Gaussian map from the ground space onto the positive orthant \u211dr+with r < n. To speed up the divergence computation, we propose the use of c(x, y) = -\u03b5 log \u3008G(x), G(y)\u3009 as the ground cost.

It is called by morphological analysis task. This task is essential because, from the morphological aspect of a word, it can know the different forms of a word, and from that, it can know its meaning. The Gonzales paper has successfully created a model to identify morphological features (MSD) of Arabic word verb only. This study will focus on adding some other Arabic type of word, which is a noun. Trying to use the current state-of-the-art approach method is neural-based with the recurrent neural network (RNN). RNN can capture more information about the sequence of sub-word like prefix, infix, root, and suffix to make a better msd identifier. The input is a single Arabic word Going through pattern extraction, sub word vectorizing, verb form identification, pronoun and type of word identification, and finally MSD identification process to see the result. This study helps to improve the last gap (morphological analyzer on POS noun) and enhances what can be identified from the previous approach to perform better.

This study aims to evaluate existing business processes and design, and implement the results of business process re-engineering (BPR) in the official trip system which is supported by digitization and digitalization with a multi-unit integration approach at one of the private universities in Indonesia, Telkom University. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study uses a mixed-method with an embedded design approach. The quantitative method was carried out by calculating the performance of official trip procedures before and after the BPR. Meanwhile, the qualitative method was carried out by conducting interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with key informants in this study.

Findings: The BPR process has resulted in radical changes to the official trip system at the university, namely from a mixed system of manual\/offline & online to completely online, from a very centralized to decentralized decision process, and the availability of a transparent monitoring system. These changes provide significant results by increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of business processes so as to speed up time, save paper (reduce paper waste and reduce costs) and optimize employee assignments.

The assessment relies on manual visual inspection, which required experience and years of training. A computer-aided diagnose system can help neurologists assess the EEG signal. This study explores the epileptic condition by decomposing EEG signals using three levels of wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). Three orders of Daubechies mother wavelets are used. Since EEG is a non-stationary biological signal, an entropy measurement using the Shannon entropy is used to extract the signals\u2019 information. The next process is combining the features from all levels of the decomposed signals producing 14 number of features. This study reduces the number of features using the wrapper feature subset selection (WFSS) method. The searching algorithm used is the sequential backward (SBS) and forward (SFS) selection method. The multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is used for the classification method. The system achieves the highest accuracy of 91% by using seven number of features obtained from WPD(db2) + WFSS(SBS) + MLPNN. The minimum number of features is obtained using WPD(db16) + WFSS(SFS) + MLPNN, which produces six features. While the use of WFSS(SFS) in db16 produces six features with the highest increase of accuracy by 22%.

This port played an ancient international trading port that has the role to connect the western and eastern parts of the world. The greatness of the port gradually faded away, and its location has now turned into a recreational area known as Pantai Boom. For the people of Tuban, the great history of Kambang Putih port still leaves a pride that is manifested in the form of Ganggengbatik motif, especially inspired by seaweed plants. This motif is one of the classic motifs which until now still continues to be used by batik artisans. Furthermore, in order to keep up with the times, this batik motif has also started to be created by utilizing the role of technology in the form of design software.

One important parameter that can provide an accurate early warning is the earthquake\u2019s magnitude. This study proposes a method for estimating the magnitude, and some of the source parameters, of an earthquake using genetic algorithms (GAs). In this study, GAs were used to perform an inversion of Okada\u2019s model from earthquake displacement data. In the first stage of the experiment, the GA was used to inverse the displacement calculated from the forward calculation in Okada\u2019s model. The best performance of the GA was obtained by tuning the hyperparameters to obtain the most functional configuration. In the second stage, the inversion method was tested on GPS time series data from the 2011 Tohoku Oki earthquake. The earthquake\u2019s displacement was first estimated from GPS time series data using a detection and estimation formula from previous research to calculate the permanent displacement value. The proposed method can estimate an earthquake\u2019s magnitude and four source parameters (i.e., length, width, rake, and slip) close to the real values with reasonable accuracy. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The contemporary concept of EEB has been embraced by many organi-sations and attracted scholars\u2019 attention worldwide. Nevertheless, studies that explored challenges and solutions for performing EEB at the workplace are scarce. This study explored challenges and solutions in performing EEB at the workplace and focused on qualitative research methodology. The researchers interviewed 24 academicians from five leading green research Malaysian universi-ties. Valuable qualitative data and numerous challenges such as high costs of practising, lack of infrastructure, top management support, environmental attitude, green mindfulness, enforcement, and monitoring were identified as challenges in applying EEB from the interviews.

In conclusion, this study has discovered the challenges and solutions in implementing EEB for a sustainable workplace by interviewing academicians from different departments of selected Malaysian higher educational institutes. Also, poor infrastructure, high cost, and the lack of top management support, environmental attitude, green mindfulness, enforcement, and monitoring were identified as the primary challenges in performing EEB. Additionally, the research also discovered significant suggestions to resolve the challenges when implementing EEB at the workplace, such as strict rules and regula-tions, training programmes, incentives, monitoring, and communicating change and campaigns.

They have excellent geometric properties and are useful to compare probability distributions in some generative adversarial network (GAN) models. Computing them using the original Sinkhorn matrix scaling algorithm is still expensive. The running time is quadratic at O(n2) in the size n of the training dataset. This work investigates the problem of accelerating the GAN training when Sinkhorn divergence is used as a minimax objective. Let G be a Gaussian map from the ground space onto the positive orthant \u211dr+with r < n. To speed up the divergence computation, we propose the use of c(x, y) = -\u03b5 log \u3008G(x), G(y)\u3009 as the ground cost. This approximation, known as Sinkhorn with positive features, brings down the running time of the Sinkhorn matrix scaling algorithm to O(r n), which is linear in n. To solve the minimax optimization in GAN, we put forward a more efficient simultaneous stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SimSGDA) algorithm in place of the standard sequential gradient techniques. Empirical evidence shows that our model, trained using SimSGDA on the DCGAN neural architecture on tiny-coloured Cats and CelebA datasets, converges to stationary points. These are the local Nash equilibrium points. We carried out numerical experiments to confirm that our model is computationally stable. It generates samples of comparable quality to those produced by prior Sinkhorn and Wasserstein GANs. Further simulations, assessed on the similarity index measures (SSIM), show that our model\u2019s empirical convergence rate is comparable to that of WGAN-GP. \u00a9 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The paper maps and characterizes the conditions of open innovation against cleaner production in Indonesian batik small and medium enterprise (SME), particularly in Java and Madura. The mapping process is executed by classifying the batik SME into four quadrants. The diagram is a quadrant in which there are four parts to distinguish each of the ability of batik SMEs in understanding and achieving cleaner production through open innovation. This research will obtain a new method or model that can be applied by organizations to achieve cleaner production through an open innovation. The data is obtained from 182 batik SMEs located in Laweyan, Madura and Lasem (in Java Island, Indonesia). Design\/methodology\/approach: One of the problems in batik SME is the waste management from the dyeing and wax removal process. In the first stages of this research, a number of initial models were elaborated as a reference, then the results of the elaboration became a new research model. The research model that has been produced is then tested using data from respondents. Based on the test results, the model can be stated valid or not. In this study, the model is valid after testing data from 182 respondents, because all outer loading for all indicators is above 0.7. The composite reliability and AVE values of all constructs were above 0.7 and 0.5. Based on the validated research model, the data is statistically processed by using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). By using the SEM method and statistical software SMART PLS 3.0this research can be supported to achieve the research objectives. Findings: Based on data testing and processing, open innovation climate could predict a sustained relationship to open innovation with an accuracy rate of 0.466 and influence rate of 0.427, whereas open innovation could predict a sustained relationship to cleaner production with an accuracy rate of 0.183 and influence rate of 0.324. The relationships between open innovation climate and open innovation; including open innovation toward cleaner production, are statistically significant because all prediction values and accuracy in the model have met the criteria for measurement parameters based on the value of R2, p value and T-statistics to be stated as a significant relationship. Research limitations\/implications: This research provides an overview of the influence and importance of open innovation in creating an environmentally friendly production process in the context of cleaner production. Cleaner production on batik SMEs can be achieved through open innovation, both for inbound open innovation and outbound open innovation. Open innovation comprehensively provides support for batik SMEs in achieving cleaner production. Open innovation can be run well and optimally if it gets support from a conducive climate open innovation. Furthermore, the implementation of cleaner production could be a guideline for the owner to minimize the waste from batik SME production, both for natural and synthetic dyes. Some limitations in these study include the absence of influence from the existing stakeholders on batik SMEs on the implementation process of open innovation; the use of the cross-sectional approach that results in the unavailability of further analysis regarding the dynamics or improvements that occur in attaining cleaner production through open innovation; and finally providing no analysis of the differences in characteristics at each location of batik SMEs. Originality\/value: The implementation of cleaner production model is considered as one of the new methods and references in conjunction with reducing the negative impact of waste toward the environment, particularly in the traditional textile industry which is limited in waste management capability. \u00a9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Some limitations in these study include the absence of influence from the existing stakeholders on batik SMEs on the implementation process of open innovation; the use of the cross-sectional approach that results in the unavailability of further analysis regarding the dynamics or improvements that occur in attaining cleaner production through open innovation; and finally providing no analysis of the differences in characteristics at each location of batik SMEs. Originality\/value: The implementation of cleaner production model is considered as one of the new methods and references in conjunction with reducing the negative impact of waste toward the environment, particularly in the traditional textile industry which is limited in waste management capability. \u00a9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

            "A temporal disease trajectory describes the sequence of diseases that a patient has experienced over time. Electronic health records (EHRs) that contain coded disease diagnoses can be mined to find common and unusual disease trajectories that have the potential to generate clinically valuable insights into the relationship between diseases. Disease trajectories are typically identified by a sequence of timestamped diagnostic codes very similar to the event logs of timestamped activities used in process mining, and we believe disease trajectory models can be produced using process mining tools and techniques. We explored this through a case study using sequences of timestamped diagnostic codes from the publicly available MIMIC-III database of de-identified EHR data. In this paper, we present an approach that recognised the unique nature of disease trajectory models based on sequenced pairs of diagnostic codes tested for directionality. To promote reuse, we developed a set of event log transformations that mine disease trajectories from an EHR using standard process mining tools. Our method was able to produce effective and clinically relevant disease trajectory models from MIMIC-III, and the method demonstrates the feasibility of applying process mining to disease trajectory modelling. \u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

They have excellent geometric properties and are useful to compare probability distributions in some generative adversarial network (GAN) models. Computing them using the original Sinkhorn matrix scaling algorithm is still expensive. The running time is quadratic at O(n2) in the size n of the training dataset. This work investigates the problem of accelerating the GAN training when Sinkhorn divergence is used as a minimax objective. Let G be a Gaussian map from the ground space onto the positive orthant \u211dr+with r < n. To speed up the divergence computation, we propose the use of c(x, y) = -\u03b5 log \u3008G(x), G(y)\u3009 as the ground cost. This approximation, known as Sinkhorn with positive features, brings down the running time of the Sinkhorn matrix scaling algorithm to O(r n), which is linear in n. To solve the minimax optimization in GAN, we put forward a more efficient simultaneous stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SimSGDA) algorithm in place of the standard sequential gradient techniques. Empirical evidence shows that our model, trained using SimSGDA on the DCGAN neural architecture on tiny-coloured Cats and CelebA datasets, converges to stationary points. These are the local Nash equilibrium points. We carried out numerical experiments to confirm that our model is computationally stable. It generates samples of comparable quality to those produced by prior Sinkhorn and Wasserstein GANs.

Meanwhile, the nondeterministic approach succeeded in finding the word candidates, but it could not choose the correct stem due to the absence of context. In this research, the nondeterministic approach was improved by adding the context, namely words that precede and follow the ambiguous word. Like nondeterministic approach, the affix rule checker in the proposed stemmer generated several word candidates from the input word. Then, the candidates are selected using two steps. First, they filtered by root word dictionary, list of compound words, and list of rare words. Second, if there were still more than a word candidate, the best word was the one with the highest average similarity score from the word to its context and the ambiguous word itself. To calculate the similarity score of words, a word model derived from word2vec training was used. Experiment results showed that the proposed stemmer accuracy was 99.65% on average.

The IEEE 802.11ah standard occurs in the MAC and PHY layers.

            "Quantitative evaluation of stroke patients with the risk of swallowing disorder or dysphagia is required to support diagnosis and further rehabilitation planning. Fluoroscopy X-ray imaging usually is used for swallowing diagnosis, though it gives radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, quantification of muscle coordination patterns involved in swallowing based on surface electromyography (sEMG) was introduced. However, an adequate quantification of sEMG for dysphagia diagnosis still lacks standardization. In this work, potential sEMG signal features, namely the contraction duration (DUR), the time to peak of maximum contraction (TTP), and the total RMS power (TP), were further investigated to evaluate the swallowing processes in healthy subjects and post-stroke patients. The experimental scheme instructed the participant, i.e. 20 healthy subjects and 20 patients, to swallow 3 mL of water in normal swallowing mode and swallow saliva in dry swallowing mode. The proposed signal processing procedure helps to establish the feature extraction of the three features mentioned earlier. For dysphagia assessment, with the support of our proposed signal processing procedure, DUR and TTP can be used together to improve diagnosis reliability. The characteristic of both features in healthy subjects was shorter than in post-stroke patients. Also, the TP feature is useful as additional information to evaluate the role of suprahyoid (SUP) and infrahyoid (INF) muscle groups which are very important in the swallowing process. These results are promising to provide a reliable set of features in the time domain for swallowing analysis.

Currently, diagnosis and evaluation are carried out using electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis, which is performed visually by clinicians. Since EEG signals tend to be random and non-stationary, the visual inspection often provides misrepresentation of results. Numerous studies have been proposed computer-based analysis for epileptic EEG classification; however, there is still a gap to improve detection accuracy with a small number of features. Therefore, in this study, we proposed an automatic detection protocol for epileptic EEG classification. The proposed methods are relative wavelet energy and wavelet entropy for feature extraction and combined with the classifier method for automatic detection. In this study, three classes of EEG consisted of pre-ictal, ictal, and interictal were used as test data and also evaluate the proposed method. EEG signals were decomposed using wavelet transform into five conventional sub-bands, including gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta. The relative energy and entropy were then calculated in each of these bands as a feature set. These methods are chosen with consider of low-cost computing. We tested the performance of our feature extraction method using Support Vector Machine (SVM), both linear and non-linear kernels. From the simulation, the highest accuracy was 80-96.7% for ictal vs. pre-ictal, ictal vs. inter-ictal, pre-ictal vs. inter-ictal, and ictal vs. non-ictal.

            "Various methods have been developed by researchers to recognize brain abnormalities through EEG signals. One of the diseases or disorders of the brain is seizures in epilepsy. EEG signals in seizure conditions display a different pattern compared to EEG signals in normal conditions. Researchers analyzed the EEG signal using a variety of observed approaches. One phenomenon used to analyze EEG signals is signal complexity. Signal complexity captures fluctuating patterns of EEG signals quantizing them to distinguish normal and seizure signal conditions. In this study, we propose the proper feature extraction method based on the basic characteristic of the signal. We extract the EEG signal\u2019s information using entropy calculation from the intrinsic mode function (IMF entropy). Our main goal is to distinguish normal and seizure EEG signals. The entropy is calculated from the IMF resulted from empirical mode decomposition (EMD), then entropy from the relative energy of each IMF. To test the performance of the proposed feature extraction method, the support vector machine (SVM) is used as a classifier. The highest accuracy is 86.3%, sensitivity is 86.33%, and the specificity is 93.17% for three data classes: normal, interictal, and seizure. The proposed method has the potential to improve its performance, considering there are still many variations of EMD methods and decomposition levels that can be evaluated.

One of the crucial problems in this interventional procedure is poor and inconsistent needle visibility in B-mode ultrasound. In this research, some potential physical parameters, i.e., ultrasound frequency, the incident angle of the ultrasound beam, needle density, and dimension, are investigated through analytical modeling based on the resonance scattering model to understand their behavior in affecting needle visibility. 25G non-echogenic needle is used as a model object and assumed as stainless-steel hollow cylinder insonified by oblique incident plane wave varied within the frequency of 0\u201310 MHz and incident angle of 0\u00b0\u201345\u00b0. The results suggest that those physical parameters simultaneously affect the occurrence possibility of the resonant modes, which eventually affect the total scattering pressure field S P in a non-linear way. These observed behaviors in the form of the spectrum map of resonance scattering pressure amplitude can be used to adapt a more beneficial combination of those physical parameters to obtain a higher possibility of good needle visibility through practical insertion application and potential echogenic technology or adaptive beamforming. \u00a9 2021.

Taking advantage of the flexibility to perform numerical simulations with HAWASSI software, with the aim of investigating the physical and statistical properties for these cases, this paper investigates the change in wave statistics related to changes in depth, breaking and differences between long- and short-crested waves. Three different types of bathymetry are considered: run-up to the coast with slope 1\/20, waves over a shoal, and deep open-water waves. Simulations show good agreement in the examined cases compared with the available experimental data and simulations. Then predictive simulations for cases with a higher significant wave height illustrate the changes that may occur during storm events. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.",

            "This paper shows simulations of high waves over different bathymetries to collect statistical information, particularly kurtosis and crest exceedance, that quantifies the occurrence of exceptionally extreme waves. This knowledge is especially pertinent for the design and operation of marine structures, safe ship trafficking, and mooring strategies for ships near the coast. Taking advantage of the flexibility to perform numerical simulations with HAWASSI software, with the aim of investigating the physical and statistical properties for these cases, this paper investigates the change in wave statistics related to changes in depth, breaking and differences between long- and short-crested waves. Three different types of bathymetry are considered: run-up to the coast with slope 1\/20, waves over a shoal, and deep open-water waves. Simulations show good agreement in the examined cases compared with the available experimental data and simulations. Then predictive simulations for cases with a higher significant wave height illustrate the changes that may occur during storm events. \u00a9 2021 by the authors."

This research used a purposive sampling technique to determine the sample size that will be used, with criteria that the bank has been operating since 2010 and consistently published its financial reports during the research period from 2011 until 2019; therefore, the total sample obtained was 11 samples. Analysis for efficiency level is done by using linear programming Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), with test tool in the form of Frontier 4.1 and Eviews9 to find out what factors that affect efficiency. Efficiency test is done by involving input and output, while influence test used bank-specific variables comprising bank size, bank financial ratio, and macro-economy variable. Research result shows that there are only two banks that are almost close to being fully efficient firms, but the result still does not indicate that Islamic bank works efficiently. Results of the influence test show that factors affecting Islamic banking efficiency in Indonesia are bank size, Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), Non-Performing Finance (NPF), and Financing to Deposit Ratio (FDR), while other factors are not influential over the study period. \u00a9 2021.

            "Many ports worldwide continue to expand their capacity by developing a multiterminal system to catch up with the global containerized trade demand. However, this expansion strategy increases the demand for container exchange between terminals and their logistics facilities within a port, known as interterminal transport (ITT). ITT forms a complex transportation network in a large port, which must be managed efficiently given the economic and environmental implications. The use of trucks in ITT operations leads to the interterminal truck routing problem (ITTRP), which has been attracting increasing attention from researchers. One of the objectives of truck routing optimization in ITT is the minimization of empty-truck trips. Selection of the transport order (TO) based on the current truck location is critical in minimizing empty-truck trips. However, ITT entails not only transporting containers between terminals operated 24 h: in cases where containers need to be transported to a logistics facility within operating hours, empty-truck trip cost (ETTC) minimization must also consider the operational times of the transport origin and destination. Otherwise, truck waiting time might be incurred because the truck may arrive before the opening time of the facility. Truck waiting time seems trivial, but it is not, since thousands of containers move between locations within a port every day. So, truck waiting time can be a source of ITT-related costs if it is not managed wisely. Minimization of empty-truck trips and truck waiting time is considered a multiobjective optimization problem. This paper proposes a method of cooperative multiagent deep reinforcement learning (RL) to produce TO truck routes that minimize ETTC and truck waiting time. Two standard algorithms, simulated annealing (SA) and tabu search (TS) were chosen to assess the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method represents a considerable improvement over the other algorithms. \u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

Physical unclonable function (PUF) is the strongest and lightest method to securing memory devices and can be used on unmanned IoT devices. The advantage of PUF over current classical cryptography types is its compatibility on IoT devices with limited computing resources.

Material\/Methods: This was an analytical observational study with a cross-sectional design, including patients with and without preeclampsia (inpatient and outpatient). A total of 246 patients were included in this research; 138 patients had preeclampsia and 108 patients did not. All examinations of magnesium and calcium levels at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital Clinical Pathology laboratory were conducted using an ion selective electrode modified with methylthymol blue complexometric titration. Results: Patients with preeclampsia had significantly higher average serum magnesium and calcium levels than did patients without preeclampsia (2.85 vs 2.09, P=0.0001; 4.45 vs 4.85, P=0.025, respectively).

In the present study, we investigated cycloguanil analogues as a potent antimalarial agent by utilizing several studies, i.e., comparative of molecular field analysis (CoMFA), molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A CoMFA model with five partial least square regressions (PLSR) was developed to predict the pIC50value of the compound by utilizing a data set of 42 cycloguanil analogues. From statistical analysis, we obtained the r2values of the training and test sets that were 0.85 and 0.70, respectively, while q2of the leave-one-out cross-validation was 0.77. The contour maps of the CoMFA model were also interpreted to analyze the structural requirement regarding electrostatic and steric factors. The most active compound (c33) and least active compound (c8) were picked for molecular docking and MD analysis. From the docking analysis, we found that the attached substituent on the backbone structure of cycloguanil gives a significant contribution to antimalarial activity.

However, the narrow and tortuous cerebrovasculature complicates image-based assessment, especially when quantifying relative pressure. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of image-based cerebrovascular relative pressure mapping, investigating the accuracy of the routinely used reduced Bernoulli (RB), the extended unsteady Bernoulli (UB), and the full-field virtual work-energy relative pressure ((Formula presented.) WERP) method. Methods: Patient-specific in silico models were used to generate synthetic cerebrovascular 4D Flow MRI, with RB, UB, and (Formula presented.)

Cerebrovascular relative pressures were also derived in 4D Flow MRI from healthy volunteers ((Formula presented.)), acquired at two spatial resolutions (dx = 1.1 and 0.8 mm). Results: The in silico analysis indicate that accurate relative pressure estimations are inherently coupled to spatial sampling: at dx = 1.0 mm high errors are reported for all methods; at dx = 0.5 mm (Formula presented.) WERP recovers relative pressures at a mean error of 0.02 \u00b1 0.25 mm Hg, while errors remain higher for RB and UB (mean error of \u22122.18 \u00b1 1.91 and \u22122.18 \u00b1 1.87 mm Hg, respectively).

Objective: This study aimed to analyze differences in information security cultures (ISCs) across health care providers based on factors drawn from the ISC model. Methods: We used twelve factors to measure the ISCs of health care providers. This research applied a survey method with the Kruskal\u2013Wallis H Test and the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test as data analysis techniques. We collected the data through a questionnaire distributed to 470 employees of health care facilities (i.e. hospitals, community health centers, and primary care clinics) in Indonesia. Results: The results revealed the differences between health care provider types for 9 of the 12 security culture factors. Top management support, change management, and knowledge were the differentiating factors between all types of health care providers. Organizational culture and security compliance only differed in primary care clinics. Meanwhile, security behavior, soft issues and workplace independence, information security policies, training, and awareness only differed in hospitals. Conclusion: The results indicated that each type of health care provider required different approaches to develop an ISC considering the above factors.

During 2020, there were many research papers that proved our environmental and climate conditions were improving due to lockdown or large-scale restriction regulations. In contrast, the economic conditions deteriorated due to disruption in industry business activities and most people stayed at home and worked from home, which probably reduced the noise pollution. Methods: To assess whether there were differences in noise pollution before and during COVID-19. In this paper, we use various statistical methods following odds ratios, Wilcoxon and Fisher\u2019s tests and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with various comparisons of prior selection. The outcome of interest for a parameter in Bayesian inference is complete posterior distribution. Roughly, the mean of the posterior will be clear with point approximation. That being said, the median is an available choice. Findings: To make the Bayesian MCMC work, we ran the sampling from the conditional posterior distributions. It is straightforward to draw random samples from these distributions if they have regular shapes using MCMC. The case of over-standard noise per time frame, number of noise petition cases, number of industry petition cases, number of motorcycles, number of cars and density of vehicles are significant at \u03b1=5%.

Process mining is one of the approaches that can be used to visualize and analyze these complex pathways. In this study, our purpose was to use process mining to explore variations in the treatment pathways of endometrial cancer. We extracted patient data from a hospital information system, created the process model, and analyzed the variations of the 62-day pathway from a General Practitioner referral to the first treatment in the hospital. We also analyzed the variations based on three different criteria: the type of the first treatment, the age at diagnosis, and the year of diagnosis. This approach should be of interest to others dealing with complex medical and healthcare processes. \u00a9 2021 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press. \u00a9 2021 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.

A complicated procedure had to be introduced to derive design loads considering the uncertainties and limitations. The proposed numerical solutions are developed to minimize those uncertainties by introducing the state-of-the-art numerical tools to accurately model the flow field near the FSRU and the surrounding wave field.

The contactless hand gesture sensor is an essential part needed for the HMI system as previously mentioned. Several hand gestures with a similar Doppler response will become problems in applying Doppler radar as a hand gesture sensor that requires a more complex recognition method. This paper proposes spatial diversity implementation for obtaining more accurate hand gesture features to cope with this problem. Array radar was selected as a sensor configuration to create the spatial diversity feature. In this paper, an array configuration of four Continuous Wave (CW) radars is proposed as a contactless sensor for hand gestures. Peak detection based on cross-correlation was employed to determine the time position of the hand gesture Doppler response detected by each CW radar. The time position pattern then becomes a feature of each hand gesture used. The CW radar array is realized with an operating frequency of 10 GHz by using the HB 100 as a CW radar component. The experimental results show that the proposed method can distinguish the hand gesture feature with an accuracy of 96.6 % at a sensing distance of 50 cm. It can differentiate the hand gesture pairs that have the opposite direction movement with a similar Doppler effect, and also requires simple data processing for recognizing different hand gestures. \u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.",

However, the traditional forecasting method, particularly machine learning, often does not consider the condition of the data, although it has forms of the count, such as the number of cases. This study employs an autoregression model using Poisson distribution in predicting the COVID-19 future cases, namely the positive and recovery number. We compare the Poisson Autoregression with several well-known forecasting methods, namely ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, BATS, and Prophet. This study found that Poisson Autoregression could create an accurate prediction with MAPE below 20% and tend to follows the actual data for the next 8 to 14 days to the future. Thus, this approach can forecast the future cases of COVID-19 and other cases that use count data in Jakarta, like the number of citizen complaints or transportation context. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

The assessment relies on manual visual inspection, which required experience and years of training. A computer-aided diagnose system can help neurologists assess the EEG signal. This study explores the epileptic condition by decomposing EEG signals using three levels of wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). Three orders of Daubechies mother wavelets are used. Since EEG is a non-stationary biological signal, an entropy measurement using the Shannon entropy is used to extract the signals\u2019 information. The next process is combining the features from all levels of the decomposed signals producing 14 number of features. This study reduces the number of features using the wrapper feature subset selection (WFSS) method. The searching algorithm used is the sequential backward (SBS) and forward (SFS) selection method. The multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is used for the classification method. The system achieves the highest accuracy of 91% by using seven number of features obtained from WPD(db2) + WFSS(SBS) + MLPNN. The minimum number of features is obtained using WPD(db16) + WFSS(SFS) + MLPNN, which produces six features. While the use of WFSS(SFS) in db16 produces six features with the highest increase of accuracy by 22%. This indicates that the use of WFSS can obtain an optimal number of features set and can improve the system\u2019s performance. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

However, the implementation and effect of the BUMDes program are questionable. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of BUMDes in encouraging rural entrepreneurship and strengthening rural economic development. In addition, this study also explores challenges in implementing the BUMDes program. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study uses a qualitative method with a case study approach. Data were obtained through in-depth interviews using purposive sampling techniques to key people in management at five BUMDes in Garut Regency, West Java, Indonesia, which have successfully implemented the BUMDes program. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that BUMDes are proven to encourage rural entrepreneurship with the dimensions of exploration and empowerment, capacity building and the support and involvement of all stakeholders. BUMDes were established in accordance with government policies based on the village discussion process as the culture of the Indonesian people by involving elements of the village government, associations and the community. However, the challenges in implementing BUMDes are still faced by managers including implementation and regulatory mismatches, lack of qualified human resources and lack of synergy between the village government and BUMDes. Research limitations\/implications: In this study, the development of a local economic empowerment program as a driver of rural entrepreneurship is carried out in the Indonesian context. In addition, based on the unique nature of case studies, making this study can only be implemented in cases that have similar characteristics. Therefore, in the context of other countries, it can be done by modifying the results obtained based on the conditions and potential of each region. Originality\/value: Although recognition of entrepreneurship is one of the main determinants of rural economic development, empirical research in this area is relatively rare.

            "In an electronic voting system, authentication is used to ensure that the voter is legitimate without knowing his\/her identity, while the vote collectors verify the data is received from a legitimate user without knowing the identity of the voter. One of the authentication schemes that fulfilled this requirement is called a deniable authentication scheme, where the receiver can prove the source of the message while another party cannot identify the source of the message. In 2013, Li-Takagi et al. proposed a deniable authentication scheme. However, Li-Takagi's scheme has weaknesses if the receiver fully cooperates with the third party. In this case, the third party can identify the source of a given message. In the proposed method, zero-knowledge proof is introduced to preserve the anonymity of the deniable authentication scheme when the receiver fully cooperates with the third party. Based on the analysis, the proposed scheme fulfills the requirement of the deniable authentication scheme when the receiver fully cooperates with the third party. However, the proposed scheme has additional computation costs for securing the shared secret key. Two attack schemes that are carried out on both Li-Takagi and the proposed scheme are the MITM attack and the impersonation attack. The probability of breaking the proposed scheme using an MITM attack is lower than when using Li-Takagi's scheme, but the probability of breaking the proposed scheme using an impersonation attack is the same as Li-Takagi's scheme.  \u00a9 2021 ACM.",

            "Dyslexia is considered the most common appearance of a learning disability in the world. Dyslexic students often suffer from emotional issues because of their educational failure experiences. Dyslexia cannot be cured. However, proper and continuous treatment can help students to achieve better results in their studies. The sooner the intervention happens, the better the outcome will be. The research presents the design and development of a mobile application to help dyslexic students to learn how to read. The application is called Learning Dyslexia (Leady). The Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model is used for developing the application. It uses a multisensory approach as the teaching method. Leady aims at young learners so that they can have the intervention from an earlier age. The application design also complies with the appropriate design for dyslexic students, such as in the selection of used fonts and background color. Then, Leady is demonstrated to five dyslexia caretakers (the teachers or parents) from a dyslexia school in Bandung. From the conducted survey, it can be inferred that the method is integrated well since all respondents agree that Leady can help dyslexic students to learn how to read. Most of them agree that the used method in Leady is suitable for dyslexic students. \u00a9 2021 CommIT Journal. All rights reserved.",

In order to enhance their understanding of speech, some support like speech text recognition (STR) texts or annotation have potentials to consolidate and verify their understanding of speech content. Furthermore, after speech if students were asked to write the report with some scaffolding will help students to concentrate and understand speech content deeply. Therefore, in this study, we developed a smart learning environment (SLE) that students can learn presentation slides or articles with annotation feature before class, listen and learn presentations with STR texts feature during class, then writing reports with SQCP scaffolding using Google Docs feature after class in flipped classrooms. Participants in this study were 25 graduate students that took seminar course in one semester to learn the speech. The result revealed that transcription generated by STR texts helped students to understand the presenter's speech before writing SQCP reports. In addition, the annotation triggered students to ask questions during class in order to get a deep understanding. Google Docs was useful to help students writing reports because students usually already use it in daily academic life. Moreover, regarding students' perceptions toward SLE it was found STR texts really help their speech understanding and report writing.

The creation of a sustainable competitive advantage is determined by the ability of the palm oil industry to utilize limited resources and capabilities. The purpose of this study was to analyze the determinants of the creation of sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) in the palm oil industry in Riau, Indonesia. The model framework uses organizational-level SCA dimensions. Four dimensions are used to measure SCA in the palm oil industry in Riau, namely value, scarce resource, inability to replicate, irreplaceable. Questionnaires were distributed to oil palm industry players in Riau with 81 respondents. The analysis technique uses Structural Equation Model with Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS). The results showed that the SCA in the palm oil industry in Riau was at a moderate level. Although the competitive advantage of being sustainable in the palm oil industry in Riau is in the medium category, test results on SCA dimensions found that each latent variable forms a significant SCA framework with a reflective constructive relationship model. The three dominant and recommended dimensions that shape the construction of SCA in the palm oil industry are value, scarce resource, and irreplaceable. \u00a9 Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/4.0\/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",

            "Reliable data transmission capacity is a crucial factor in supporting high-data-rate communication for smart cities by implementing the Internet of Things. Optical fiber has become the most favorable transmission media by taking advantage of optical signals. However, when optical signals propagate through optical fibers, disturbances occur as the transmission distance increases. These disturbances affect the system performance indicated by the deteriorating transmission data quality in terms of the quality factor (Q-factor) and bit error rate. These parameters are vulnerable to certain factors that can alter signal transmissions such as fiber attenuation, group velocity dispersion (GVD), and self-phase modulation (SPM) as a nonlinear effect. In this study, the effects of these factors on a single-channel, single-mode fiber are investigated using a bit rate of 10 Gbps at various transmission distances and source power levels. The parametric study of attenuation, GVD, and SPM with non-return-to-zero (NRZ) modulation format are considered at various transmission distances, from 10 to 100 km, and input powers of 5 and 10 dBm are simulated using OptiSystem to characterize the parameters of Q-factor and received power. The results indicate that the performance of the system deteriorates as the transmission distance increases, and the dominant effect that impacts the performance is GVD.

The population did not deviate from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (p > 0.05) based on SNP g.880A>G. The SNP g.880A>G was significantly associated with MW but not significant in BW and WW. The GG genotype (32.33 \u00b1 4.81 kg) was higher MW than the AG genotype (27.19 \u00b1 1.86 kg). In conclusion, the findings suggested that SNP g.880A>G of the MC4R gene could be used as a potential selection tool for high MW in F1 cross Dorper x Garut sheep. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

            "ADHD (Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactive Disorder) is one of the behavioral disorders experienced by children. This disorder causes a person to have difficulty concentrating and behave excessively. Referring to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there are 3 types of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive impulsivity, and combination. The symptoms of ADHD appear before 12 years of age and last at least 6 months. Therefore, the role of parents is crucial to find out the presence of ADHD in children. The role of parents is significant in determining the presence of ADHD in children because 83.5% of children have a history of undiagnosed ADHD. This can have a bad impact in the future and cause symptoms that get worse over time. This paper proposes a screening tool for the early identification of ADHD in children using artificial intelligence. Using the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and certainty factor method can help identify the type of ADHD based on the symptoms experienced. Moreover, in decision making, the CBR method looks for similarities to previous cases where there are many case data so that the level of similarity is high. In addition, the certainty factor can strengthen confidence and certainty so that the results are accurate. Referring to the system created and the results of the tests that have been carried out, the accuracy value is 100%  \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

This study investigated a cold pool event (January 1-2, 2021) related to a heavy rainfall system over the coastal region of Lampung, Southern Sumatra, within a high-resolution model simulation using a regional numerical weather prediction of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) with convection permitting of 1 km spatial resolution, which was validated by satellite and radar data observations. It is important to note that the intensity, duration, timing, and structure of heavy rainfall simulated were in good agreement with satellite-observed rainfall. The results also showed that a cold pool (CP) plays an important role in inducing Mesoscale Convective Complex (MCC) and was responsible for the development of an offshore propagation of land-based convective systems due to the late afternoon rainfall over inland. This study also suggests that the propagation speed of the CP 8.8 m\u00b7s-1 occurring over the seaside of the coastal region, the so-called CP-coastal, is a plausible mechanism for the speed of the offshore-propagating convection, which is dependent on both the background prevailing wind and outflow.

On the other hand, Indonesia's broadband needs are growing rapidly in this digital era, no exception for the Indonesian government. The High Throughput Satellite (HTS) can be the best solution to overcome the inequality of network connectivity distribution across Indonesia. This paper discussed the techno-economic analysis of advanced HTS for Indonesian Government multifunctional services. The objective is to give an overview concerning the potential investment of advanced HTS with specifications in the Ku-Band frequency spectrum from a techno-economic perspective for the Indonesian government. The result shows that the possible capacity generated by Kuband HTS is sizeable, around 35.51 - 319.26 Gbps. Thus, it is good technical potential for fulfilling the Indonesian government's enormous capacity demand for broadband access. Then, from an economic aspect the NPV of the investment is 32.2 million USD, IRR shows 15.71% greater than MARR of 15%. Then, the payback period reached by this project is estimated 8 years 6 months with the profitability index of this project is 1.03.

High waves were observed not only at the bay\u2019s head but also in several other locations along the bay. This high amplification is most likely influenced by Palu Bay\u2019s bathymetry and the underwater sill in front of Palu City. The numerical simulations of the two-dimensional shallow water equations were used to investigate these aspects. The numerical scheme is validated first with analytical solutions of standing waves in a parabolic bay, as a model of Palu Bay. The results show a significant amplification at the bay\u2019s head, as a result of the bay\u2019s reduced cross-sectional area. Some amplifications were also observed along the channel sides, and the role of the underwater sill was also investigated. Next, we carried out simulations with the actual Palu Bay bathymetry and a hypothetical tsunami $N-$wave and\/or Gaussian humps. The simulation result depicts extremely high waves recorded along the Palu Bay coastline, which is consistent with the field survey; additionally, the wave signal at Pantoloan corresponds reasonably well to the tide gauge data.

Many studies in it focused on minimizing cost and distance with assumption that all nodes are visited. Ironically, number of unserved customers (nodes) in a single trip was rarely explored and often ignored. Based on this problem, this work aims to minimize the total travel distance and the number of unserved customers in single routing cycle. The solution is developed by combining the stable marriage algorithm and k-means clustering in the clustering process. The nearest neighbour algorithm is used in the routing process. This work proposes two contributions. The first is the usage of the stable marriage and k-means clustering. The second is concerning the predetermined distribution of the vehicles in the solution to reduce the number of unserved customers. In the simulation, this proposed model is compared with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA), partition-based algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (PBA-NN), genetic algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (GA-NN) and simulated annealing algorithm (SA). Based on the simulation result, it is found that the proposed model performs moderately as a trade-off between the SA and PBA-NN. In the number of unserved customers aspect, when the number of customers is low, the proposed model creates 71 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. Meanwhile, when the number of customers is high, the proposed model creates 73 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. In the total travel distance aspect, when the number of customers is low (50 persons), the proposed model creates 63 percent higher than the GA-NN model and 48 percent lower than the SA model.

            "Quantitative evaluation of stroke patients with the risk of swallowing disorder or dysphagia is required to support diagnosis and further rehabilitation planning. Fluoroscopy X-ray imaging usually is used for swallowing diagnosis, though it gives radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, quantification of muscle coordination patterns involved in swallowing based on surface electromyography (sEMG) was introduced. However, an adequate quantification of sEMG for dysphagia diagnosis still lacks standardization. In this work, potential sEMG signal features, namely the contraction duration (DUR), the time to peak of maximum contraction (TTP), and the total RMS power (TP), were further investigated to evaluate the swallowing processes in healthy subjects and post-stroke patients. The experimental scheme instructed the participant, i.e. 20 healthy subjects and 20 patients, to swallow 3 mL of water in normal swallowing mode and swallow saliva in dry swallowing mode. The proposed signal processing procedure helps to establish the feature extraction of the three features mentioned earlier. For dysphagia assessment, with the support of our proposed signal processing procedure, DUR and TTP can be used together to improve diagnosis reliability. The characteristic of both features in healthy subjects was shorter than in post-stroke patients. Also, the TP feature is useful as additional information to evaluate the role of suprahyoid (SUP) and infrahyoid (INF) muscle groups which are very important in the swallowing process. These results are promising to provide a reliable set of features in the time domain for swallowing analysis. Notably, this can also be utilized as a feature for supporting the automatic classification of dysphagia diagnosis. \u00a9 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. All rights reserved.",

Generally, chemotherapy can be evaluated in various ways, phsychal examination, radiology examination, and laboratory examination. This study aims is to examine if the measurement of the platelet\/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be used to predict a patient's response to chemotherapy. Methods: Analytic observational study with a case-control design conducted in the Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung from 2017 to 2018. This study used the medical record of ovarian cancer patients with post-surgery complete blood counts and histopathological reports. The sample size was determined based on the categorical test's statistical calculation to obtain a total number of at minimal 90 samples. All the study subjects who had undergone complete chemotherapy were followed up for 6 months. Their response to chemotherapy was assessed with a clinical examination, ultrasonography, and a CA-125 blood test every 3 months. Results: In 2017-2018, 504 patients were diagnosed with ovarian cancer at the Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung, Indonesia. After reassessment, 116 patients had stage I to III ovarian cancer and underwent cytoreduction followed by platinum chemotherapy. The age, cancer stage, and types of epithelial cells in the platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients were characterized. There were significant differences between the two groups in age and cancer stage characteristics (p < 0.05). The increase in platelet\/lymphocyte (p = 0.003) and neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratios (p = 0.026) are associated with the increase in the response to platinum chemotherapy against epithelium-based cancers. Conclusion: A patient's NLR and PLR are strongly associated with his response to chemotherapy. \u00a9 2021. All Rights Reserved.",

The development of encyclopedias used automatic text summarization with the TextRank method because from one query that is searched there are many meanings of words that must be summarized. This method starts by selecting documents that are relevant to the query, then summarizes the selected documents using the TextRank method so that they get a summary based on all the word meanings, finally testing the summary results by the system by comparing them with summary targets that are constructed manually by humans. The application of the TextRank method for automatic text summarization has an average value of F-Score 0.6173.

Then we need a Qur'anic vocabulary encyclopedia that focuses on explaining the meaning of the words in it. The development of encyclopedias used automatic text summarization with the TextRank method because from one query that is searched there are many meanings of words that must be summarized. This method starts by selecting documents that are relevant to the query, then summarizes the selected documents using the TextRank method so that they get a summary based on all the word meanings, finally testing the summary results by the system by comparing them with summary targets that are constructed manually by humans.

            "Recent deep learning-based syllabification models generally give low error rates for high-resource languages with big datasets but sometimes produce high error rates for the low-resource ones. In this paper, two procedures: massive data augmentation and validation, are proposed to improve a deep learning-based syllabification, using a combination of bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and conditional random fields (CRF) for a low-resource Indonesian language. The massive data augmentation comprises four methods: transposing nuclei, swapping consonant-graphemes, flipping onsets, and creating acronyms. Meanwhile, the validation is implemented using a phonotactic-based scheme. A preliminary investigation on 50k Indonesian words informs that those augmentation methods significantly enlarge the dataset size by 12.8M valid words based on the phonotactic rules. An examination is then performed using 5-fold cross-validation. It reports that the augmentation methods significantly improve the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model for 50k formal words and 100k named-entities datasets. A detailed investigation informs that augmenting the training set can reduce the word error rate (WER) coming from the long formal words and named entities \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

As a result, the number of users of this technology is growing, resulting in network congestion in a dense urban area in Indonesia. The answer to this issue is to raise the network's 4G LTE-Advanced frequency. The purpose of this study is to plan a 4G LTE-Advanced network in Central Jakarta utilizing quantitative techniques and two approaches, namely capacity planning, and coverage planning, and then simulate the results by using a network software simulator called Forsk Atoll.

Dynamic Lot Sizing Model is one method to get a minimum inventory level which in essence can reach the minimum costs that must be incurred by the company. This model seeks to eliminate the assumption that fixed demand level is calculated the same for each period that is commonly used in the EOQ model. This paper considers dynamic lot sizing, stochastic demand, by selecting one supplier, each supplier has quantity discount system and also transportation cost.

            "One of the activities that can be done to control costs in production activities is by optimizing the level of supply and demand. Dynamic Lot Sizing Model is one method to get a minimum inventory level which in essence can reach the minimum costs that must be incurred by the company. This model seeks to eliminate the assumption that fixed demand level is calculated the same for each period that is commonly used in the EOQ model. This paper considers dynamic lot sizing, stochastic demand, by selecting one supplier, each supplier has quantity discount system and also transportation cost.

Reduced extracellular levels of calcium and magnesium constitute the pathogenesis of eclampsia. A reduction in the calcium-magnesium ratio may aid in the detection and prevention of preeclampsia. Material\/Methods: This was an analytical observational study with a cross-sectional design, including patients with and without preeclampsia (inpatient and outpatient). A total of 246 patients were included in this research; 138 patients had preeclampsia and 108 patients did not. All examinations of magnesium and calcium levels at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital Clinical Pathology laboratory were conducted using an ion selective electrode modified with methylthymol blue complexometric titration. Results: Patients with preeclampsia had significantly higher average serum magnesium and calcium levels than did patients without preeclampsia (2.85 vs 2.09, P=0.0001; 4.45 vs 4.85, P=0.025, respectively). Patients with preeclampsia demonstrated significantly lower serum calcium-magnesium ratios than did patients without preeclampsia (1.98 vs 2.60, P=0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis on the serum calcium-magnesium ratio showed an area under the curve of 68.0% (P=0.0001), with a cutoff value of 2.36 (sensitivity 64.8%, specificity 62.3%), indicating that patients with serum calcium-magnesium ratios of <2.36 were predicted to have a risk of preeclampsia. Conclusions: Patients with preeclampsia had significantly lower serum calcium-magnesium ratios than did patients without preeclampsia; therefore, a low calcium-magnesium ratio could be a risk factor for preeclampsia. \u00a9 2021 International Scientific Information, Inc..

Photovoltaics have non-linear voltage and current characteristics which influenced by temperature and exposure of solar irradiation so that the maximum power point (MPP) can change at any time. Unfortunately, operating conditions outside the MPP could reduce the efficiency of electrical power transfer from the photovoltaic system to the load. Q-learning (QL) has the potential to provide action decisions of duty cycle signal based on the state of the power gradient percentage range. The Q-learning hybrid method with Type-2 fuzzy logic control is proposed to provide correction of QL control signal by considering the uncertainty direction of power point shifting. The proposed strategy is important particularly to avoid a sudden change in solar irradiation exposure.

The characterization is conducted by simulation software to investigate and analyze the effect of different parameters of SIW BPF to the output response. Meanwhile, parametric studies as part of characterization process are applied upon the proposed filter to obtain the optimum design of filter architecture. The results of characterization show that the proposed narrowband SIW BPF with the input\/output impedances of 50 \u03a9 has the bandwidth characteristic of 84 MHz in the frequency range of 5.827 GHz to 5.911 GHz with a good frequency selectivity suitable for the desired application. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

The increasing development of the leather industry's exports can impact increasing waste from the returned products from customers. The rise in waste makes it challenging to monitor products because of the lack of sustainability aspects that can damage the environment and its resources.

            "Research on biometric technology get much attention from researchers who interest in the recognition system. One of the biometric objects that will continue to be developed is the palmprint. The hand palm line has a unique characteristic in each person or may not be the same. The palmprint image is easy to capture because clearly visible, so it does not require a specific sensor. This paper presents the automatic extraction feature with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technique to get a unique characteristic of palmprint image and identify a person. CNN will get easier to classify the image database if it has many data. CNN belongs to Supervised Learning, which requires training data to create a knowledge base. In the dataset with little training data, the system must increase the training data using augmentation methods like zoom, shear, and rotate. Still, in the palmprint, that augmentation method can change the original character of the palmprint. Our proposed method is adding training data with an edge detection image from the original image. Edge detection used in our method is Canny and Sobel. The addition of Canny and Sobel edge detection for training data is the best combination scenario for palmprint recognition. The experiment results showed that palmprint recognition using Convolution Neural Network with Canny and Sobel edge detection for training data resulted in an accuracy rate of 96.5% for 200 classes, and the Equal Error Rate (ERR) value is 3.5%. This method has been able to recognize 193 palms of 200 people. \u00a9 2021",

Therefore, the Jakarta Provincial Government needs evidence-based policies to deal with potential floods to protect residents from the threat of flood disasters. Mapping flood-prone areas in Jakarta can be a reference to minimize the significant loss and harm due to flooding. However, at this moment, it is still challenging to find an appropriate clustering model for classifying and mapping flood risk in Jakarta. Therefore, this study utilized K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means to analyze the flood-prone of 42 sub-districts in Jakarta based on four variables: groundwater usage, number of flood reports, water level during the flood, and land subsidence. According to Pseudo-F analysis, four is the optimum number of clusters. The result shows that the Fuzzy C-Means is a better model than K-Means in grouping flood-prone sub-districts in Jakarta based on the Icdrate test. The mapping of the flood-prone area in Jakarta using Fuzzy C-Means shows that some clusters are nearby. Furthermore, it suggests that sub-districts with high and relatively high flood risk are mainly located in West Jakarta and South Jakarta.

Besides location, student\u2019s academic performance and economic level are also concerned. Based on it, this work proposes coordinated public school admission model that accommodates flexible number of the concerned parameters. It is built based on the stable marriage algorithm or the deferred-acceptance algorithm as its derivative.

The prioritization of the concerned parameters is proven easily adjusted. The simulation result shows that in the over-demand condition, the proposed model creates higher average student national exam score and higher average school-home distance rather than the previous models.

In order to enhance their understanding of speech, some support like speech text recognition (STR) texts or annotation have potentials to consolidate and verify their understanding of speech content. Furthermore, after speech if students were asked to write the report with some scaffolding will help students to concentrate and understand speech content deeply.

Participants in this study were 25 graduate students that took seminar course in one semester to learn the speech. The result revealed that transcription generated by STR texts helped students to understand the presenter's speech before writing SQCP reports. In addition, the annotation triggered students to ask questions during class in order to get a deep understanding. Google Docs was useful to help students writing reports because students usually already use it in daily academic life.

            "Preliminary assessment of sub-seasonal to seasonal reforecast precipitation model (S2S) was conducted to analyze the model's performance over western Indonesia on four conditions. The ECMWF S2S model was compared to quality controlled daily precipitation data from 645 observation points over the region. The control and perturbed model for the first three time steps and the last three were utilized to obtain the best performance comparison. The analysis was conducted in monthly period, MJO events, NCS events, and when both of them were active during period of November-December-January-February (NDJF) from 1998 to 2017. The results show that the first three time steps perform much better than the last one with a slightly higher correlation coefficient from the control model with relatively similar RMSE in Natuna Islands. Spatial analysis indicates that both of the control and perturbed models can catch the variation brought by the wet season in the NDJF period, by the MJO, show a hint of NCS effect, and the combination when MJO and NCS were active at the same time. The models can depict the precipitation pattern pretty well with the tendency to overestimate low rainfall intensity and underestimate the high one. The models relatively overestimate the intensity in Sumatra for the whole period. Meanwhile, consistently good spatial performance is shown by the models over Java, both in NDJF periods or MJO events. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

MAGNET is a deep learning model architecture that combines Graph Attention Networks, BiLSTM, and BERT embeddings. Label clustering can solve the MAGNET architectural problem in dealing with a large adjacency matrix by splitting the adjacency matrix into several clusters. In addition, XLNet and GRU have been shown to have better performance than BERT and LSTM in other studies. Therefore, XLNet can replace BERT as the embedding layer, and GRU can replace LSTM as the fine-tuning layer.

In addition, an LED spotlight system that can shoot light in the direction of the target is also proposed. The encoding process is done by making a unique blinking pattern on the LED, and thus the camera and a servomotor as an object recognition system would only recognize a unique marker given by an LED. In this work the camera with OpenCV could capture a unique marker in all variant of blinking patterns. A unique marker is important on object recognition system so the camera could identify the object marked by our unique marker and ignore all other markers that might captured by the camera. In addition, analysis of the PWM signal from an LED is carried out here to determine the characteristics of the LEDs in each color, determine the accuracy of the duty cycle, and the use of the bright-dim method on the LEDs. The results show that the highest accuracy is obtained when a 50% duty cycle is used with the on and off time are set to be 1 second for all LED colors. The benefit of the proposed system is confirmed by implementing an integrated control system as a unique marker. The effectiveness of the blinking LED against other laser interferences is also discussed. \u00a9 2021. All Rights Reserved.",

            "Background: The Malaysian government reacted to the pandemic's economic effect with the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) to cushion the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) impact on households. The ESP consists of cash assistance, utility discount, moratorium, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) cash withdrawals, credit guarantee scheme and wage subsidies. A survey carried out by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) shows that households prefer different types of financial assistance. These preferences forge the need to effectively customise ESPs to manage the economic burden among low-income households. In this study, a recommender system for such ESPs was designed by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. Methods: This study used a dataset from DOSM titled 'Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy and Individual - Round 2,' collected from April 10 to April 24, 2020. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining was followed to develop machine learning models to classify ESP receivers according to their preferred subsidies types. Four machine learning techniques-Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Na\u00efve Bayes-were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 87.6% F-score; utilities discount with 86% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 84% F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6% sensitivity, 81.2% precision and 82.4% F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance.

Therefore, this led to the need to retrieve and understand the data on the event counts for stranded marine animals based on location emergence, number of individuals, behavior, and threats to their presence. Whales are generally often stranded in very shallow areas with sloping sea floors and sand. Data were collected in this study on the incidence of stranded marine animals in 20 provinces of Indonesia from 2015 to 2019 with the focus on animals such as Balaenopteridae, Delphinidae, Lamnidae, Physeteridae, and Rhincodontidae. METHODS: Multivariate latent generalized linear model was used to compare several distributions to analyze the diversity of event counts. Two optimization models including Laplace and Variational approximations were also applied. FINDINGS: The best theta parameter in the latent multivariate latent generalized linear latent variable model was found in the Akaike Information Criterion, Akaike Information Criterion Corrected and Bayesian Information Criterion values, and the information obtained was used to create a spatial cluster. Moreover, there was a comprehensive discussion on ocean-atmosphere interaction and the reasons the animals were stranded.

The main drawback of centralized SDN controller architecture is causing bottlenecks in the network because every packet that arrives at the switch must be forwarded to the controller first. The controller will decide whether the packet is allowed to be forwarded or dropped, resulting in increased processing delay for packet processing. There are several previous methods have been proposed. However, they could not meet the need of network performance. Thus, we decide to migrate the several controller functions in the data plane. This paper presents port knocking (PkoCK) implementation in programmable data plane. PKock successfully offloads the port knocking implementation to the data plane and reduces the processing delay 19% compared to SDN-based port knocking. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

The controller will decide whether the packet is allowed to be forwarded or dropped, resulting in increased processing delay for packet processing. There are several previous methods have been proposed. However, they could not meet the need of network performance. Thus, we decide to migrate the several controller functions in the data plane. This paper presents port knocking (PkoCK) implementation in programmable data plane. PKock successfully offloads the port knocking implementation to the data plane and reduces the processing delay 19% compared to SDN-based port knocking. \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

As per understanding, this is first attempt to analyze predictability of wind speed with height. To achieve this, wind data was collected using Laser Illuminated Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system at 10 m, 20 m, 40 m, 90 m, 120 m, 200 m, 250 m and 300 m heights. The collected data is used for training and testing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for hourly wind speed prediction for each of the future 12\u00a0hours, using 48 previous hourly values. Careful analyses of short term wind speed prediction at different heights and future hours show that wind speed is predicted more accurately at higher heights. For example, the mean absolute percent error decreases from 0.25 to 0.12 corresponding to heights 10 to 300 m, respectively for the 6th future hour prediction, an improvement of around 50%. The performance of ANN method is compared with hybrid genetic algorithm and ANN method namely GANN.

            "The importance of good water quality for human use and consumption can never be underestimated, and its quality is determined through effective monitoring of the water quality index. Different approaches have been employed in the treatment and monitoring of water quality parameters (WQP). Presently, water quality is carried out through laboratory experiments, which requires costly reagents, skilled labor, and consumes time. Thereby making it necessary to search for an alternative method. Recently, machine learning tools have been successfully implemented in the monitoring, estimation, and predictions of river water quality index to provide an alternative solution to the limitations of laboratory analytical methods. In this study, the potentials of one of the machine learning tools (artificial neural network) were explored in the predictions and estimation of the Kelantan River basin. Water quality data collected from the 14 stations of the River basin was used for modeling and predicting (WQP). As for WQP analysis, the results obtained from this study show that the best prediction was obtained from the prediction of pH. The low kurtosis values of pH indicate that the appearance of outliers give a negative impact on the performance. As for WQP analysis for each station, we found that the WQP prediction in station 1, 2, and 3 give the good results. This is related to the available data of those stations that are more than the available data in other stations, except station 8. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.",

Using a single case study methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with various departments of supply chain agents working for a dairy company. Data were collected regarding the supply chain network of the dairy processing company, managers' knowledge of supply chain risk management, and risks inherent in the dairy supply chain. In general, the company is aware of supply chain risks. By employing the House of Risk (HOR) model combining the two methods of Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD), the risks identified in the supply chain were assessed and prioritized. Several recommendations have been made to mitigate high priority risks. The study found 15 risk events in the company's supply chain process and 11 risk agents, of which seven were included in the priority risk agent category, which contributed 79.55% to the company's total risk. To deal with the priority risk agents, the company should take seven risk mitigation actions to minimize the adverse impact on the company. This research is the latest in risk mapping and risk mitigation action plans for the dairy industry, especially KPBS Pangalengan, with the proposed mitigations including routine quality control (PA1), re-checking machine settings (PA5), and other matters related to operational activities should be carried out by the operational manager to achieve maximum mitigation results. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

In some cases, it is difficult to distinguish one type of lung sound to another. It takes the expertise, experience and sensitivity of clinicians to avoid misdiagnosis. Therefore, many studies have proposed a feature extraction method combined with automatic classification method for the detection of lung disease through lung sound analysis. Since the complex nature of biological signals which are produced by complex processes, the multiscale method is an interesting feature extraction method to be developed. This study proposes an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a modified gray level difference (GLD) for a lung sound classification.

People can distinguish many apples based on their colors and shapes, such as the Braeburn Apple with skin color varies from orange to red, the Pink Lady Apple that is red with pseudo pink, the Crismon Snow Apple that has dark red skin. Recently, computers can automatically recognize them using digital image processing techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In this paper, a CNN-based classification model of apple types is developed using 1856 apple images from three classes derived from the fruit-360 dataset on the Kaggle website, and its robustness is then examined. Two types of testing have been carried out in this study: testing five scenarios for sharing training data and testing five scenarios for robustness to noise. An examination based on 5-fold cross-validation shows that CNN is robust to decreasing the portion of training set size up to 50% to get high accuracy of 99.97% in classifying 50% testing set, which is better than previous models that use VGG16, faster R-CNN, and Tanh. Decreasing the portion training set to 40% and 30% reduces the accuracy to 95.97% and 95.29%, respectively. Adding low-level noises of 10% into the testing images decreases the accuracy slightly to 99.17%. However, high-level noises of 50% drastically make the accuracy drastically drops to 63.93%. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

            "Apple is one of the popular fruits for public consumption. People can distinguish many apples based on their colors and shapes, such as the Braeburn Apple with skin color varies from orange to red, the Pink Lady Apple that is red with pseudo pink, the Crismon Snow Apple that has dark red skin. Recently, computers can automatically recognize them using digital image processing techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In this paper, a CNN-based classification model of apple types is developed using 1856 apple images from three classes derived from the fruit-360 dataset on the Kaggle website, and its robustness is then examined. Two types of testing have been carried out in this study: testing five scenarios for sharing training data and testing five scenarios for robustness to noise. An examination based on 5-fold cross-validation shows that CNN is robust to decreasing the portion of training set size up to 50% to get high accuracy of 99.97% in classifying 50% testing set, which is better than previous models that use VGG16, faster R-CNN, and Tanh. Decreasing the portion training set to 40% and 30% reduces the accuracy to 95.97% and 95.29%, respectively. Adding low-level noises of 10% into the testing images decreases the accuracy slightly to 99.17%. However, high-level noises of 50% drastically make the accuracy drastically drops to 63.93%. \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

            "The development of the broiler poultry industry has experienced a significant increase along with the increasing public demand for meat consumption. However, in 2019, many broiler poultry farmers are forced to close down their businesses because the price of broilers in living conditions continues to be belowthe Production Cost. Further, broiler poultry farmers also experience obstacles including unpredictable price fluctuations and intense competition. Innovation ambidexterity is the innovation capability in managing exploration and exploitation simultaneously to improve firm performance. Several influential factors in increasing innovation ambidexterity include technological capability, owner-manager characteristic, and environmental dynamism. This study aims to develop a model that describes innovation ambidexterity in broiler poultry farmers to improve firm performance. This study also analyzes the factors that can influence innovation ambidexterity and its effect on firm performance. This research mainly uses quantitative methods for its analysis. The sampling technique uses non-probability sampling with convenience sampling technique. Data collection was conducted by distributing 223 questionnaires to broiler poultry farmers in West Java. The analysis technique uses Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) which includes measurement model analysis and structural model analysis. The results of this study indicate that innovation ambidexterity has a direct influence on firm performance, while the influence of environmental dynamism on firm performance is partly mediated by innovation ambidexterity. In addition, technological capability and owner-manager characteristics have a positive influence on innovation ambidexterity and have an indirect influence on firm performance. In the near future, implications of this study will be discussed in a separate manuscript. \u00a9 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.",

Therefore, several conditions need to be considered, namely the pH value of the water, the value of the nutrient solution, and the circulating water pump. Manually controlling water and environmental conditions will consume a lot of time and energy and is susceptible to human measurement errors. So it is necessary to design an integrated control system on hydroponic plants, including a water pH control system and a nutrient solution control system. This system uses several components, including a pH sensor, EC (Electrical Conductivity) sensor, Mega 2560 Pro as a microcontroller, a 4V 5 channel relay, and a peristaltic pump as an actuator that will move to remove pH-up, pH-down, and AB-mix nutrients. This system is also based on the Internet of Things (IoT), where data obtained from pH sensors and EC sensors will be processed by a microcontroller and then sent to the IoT Antares platform via the available communication modules. Data is stored on Antares's cloud server to be displayed in a User Interface to the user. Based on the test results, the monitoring and integrated control systems for hydroponic plants have been successfully created and run well. The accuracy of the pH sensor is 99.99%, and the EC sensor is 99.93%. From the response time characteristics of the pH control system, the rise time is 2.5 minutes, the peak time is 5 minutes, the maximum overshoot is 131.53%, the settling time is 16 minutes, and the steady-state error value is 109.90%.

We then propose a design methodology to obtain Huygens' metasurfaces with two electric and two magnetic resonances in a single meta-atom configuration, paving the way for further metasurface bandwidth improvement. \u00a9 2021 URSI."

Specifically, the study aimed to examine how forest areas are influencing environmental degradation. Given the inevitable link between forests and carbon dioxide (CO2), the current study focused on examining the impact of changes in forestry on the levels of CO2emissions in top Asian economies, including China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. To this end, the current study was quantitative in nature and utilized advanced methodology such as econometrics of quantile-on-quantile (Q-Q) regression to investigate the forests-environmental degradation link. In particular, we examined the effect of quantiles of forest areas on the quantile of climate change in top Asian economies using the time series data from 1990 to 2018. The findings confirmed that forest areas have a negative and significant impact on climate degradation in the majority of the groups of quantiles for all countries. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of forests in controlling environmental degradation in Asian economies.

Disease trajectories are typically identified by a sequence of timestamped diagnostic codes very similar to the event logs of timestamped activities used in process mining, and we believe disease trajectory models can be produced using process mining tools and techniques. We explored this through a case study using sequences of timestamped diagnostic codes from the publicly available MIMIC-III database of de-identified EHR data.

To promote reuse, we developed a set of event log transformations that mine disease trajectories from an EHR using standard process mining tools.

Many Muslims have to learn Arabic in addition to knowing the meaning of it. One of the most critical aspects of the Arabic language is morphology and identifying the word's morphological description. It is called by morphological analysis task. This task is essential because, from the morphological aspect of a word, it can know the different forms of a word, and from that, it can know its meaning. The Gonzales paper has successfully created a model to identify morphological features (MSD) of Arabic word verb only. This study will focus on adding some other Arabic type of word, which is a noun. Trying to use the current state-of-the-art approach method is neural-based with the recurrent neural network (RNN). RNN can capture more information about the sequence of sub-word like prefix, infix, root, and suffix to make a better msd identifier. The input is a single Arabic word Going through pattern extraction, sub word vectorizing, verb form identification, pronoun and type of word identification, and finally MSD identification process to see the result. This study helps to improve the last gap (morphological analyzer on POS noun) and enhances what can be identified from the previous approach to perform better. This model successfully identifies MSD with 99% accuracy and 97% F1-score.

            "Phrase table combination in pivot approaches can be an effective method to deal with low-resource language pairs. The common practice to generate phrase tables in pivot approaches is to use standard symmetrization, i.e., grow-diag-final-and. Although some researchers found that the use of non-standard symmetrization could improve bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores, the use of non-standard symmetrization has not been commonly employed in pivot approaches. In this study, we propose a strategy that uses the non-standard symmetrization of word alignment in phrase table combination. The appropriate symmetrization is selected based on the highest BLEU scores in each direct translation of source\u2013target, source\u2013pivot, and pivot\u2013target of Kazakh\u2013English (Kk\u2013En) and Japanese\u2013Indonesian (Ja\u2013Id). Our experiments show that our proposed strategy outperforms the direct translation in Kk\u2013En with absolute improvements of 0.35 (a 11.3% relative improvement) and 0.22 (a 6.4% relative improvement) BLEU points for 3-gram and 5-gram, respectively. The proposed strategy shows an absolute gain of up to 0.11 (a 0.9% relative improvement) BLEU points compared to direct translation for 3-gram in Ja\u2013Id. Our proposed strategy using a small phrase table obtains better BLEU scores than a strategy using a large phrase table. The size of the target monolingual and feature function weight of the language model (LM) could reduce perplexity scores. \u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

The purpose of steganography is that a message can only be seen by the two related parties without being noticed by the other person. In this study, a steganography system was designed using image media to hide a secret message. Image compression is first performed using compressive sensing (CS) so that an image with a smaller resolution is obtained. Stationary wavelet transforms (SWT) are used as the transformation method and singular value decomposition (SVD) is used as the insertion method. To reconstruct or return the compressed message to the original message, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is used.

            "Facial expression recognition (FER) serves as an essential tool for understanding human emotional behaviors. Facial expressions provide a wealth of information about intentions, emotions, and other inner states. Over the past two decades, the development of an automatic FER device has become one of the most demanding multimedia research areas in human\u2013computer interaction systems. Several automatic systems have been introduced and have achieved precise identification accuracies. Due to the complex nature of the human face, however, problems still exist. Researchers are still struggling to develop effective methods for extracting features from images because of unclear features. This work proposes a methodology that improves high-performance computing in terms of the facial expression recognition accuracy. To achieve the goal of high accuracy, a hybrid method is proposed using the dual-tree m-band wavelet transform (DTMBWT) algorithm based on energy, entropy, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). It is accompanied by the use of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the classification scheme to provide efficient identification of database images in terms of facial expressions. Using the DTMBWT, it is possible to derive many expression features from decomposition levels 1 to 6. Moreover, along with the GLCM features, the contrast and homogeneity features can be retrieved. All the features are eventually categorized and recognized with the aid of the GMM classifier. The proposed algorithms are tested using Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) database with seven different facial expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, neutral, surprise, and disgust. The results of the experiments show that the highest precision of the proposed technique is 99.53%, which is observed at the 4thdecomposition level of the DTMBWT. \u00a9 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

            "ADHD (Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactive Disorder) is one of the behavioral disorders experienced by children. This disorder causes a person to have difficulty concentrating and behave excessively. Referring to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there are 3 types of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive impulsivity, and combination. The symptoms of ADHD appear before 12 years of age and last at least 6 months. Therefore, the role of parents is crucial to find out the presence of ADHD in children. The role of parents is significant in determining the presence of ADHD in children because 83.5% of children have a history of undiagnosed ADHD. This can have a bad impact in the future and cause symptoms that get worse over time. This paper proposes a screening tool for the early identification of ADHD in children using artificial intelligence. Using the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and certainty factor method can help identify the type of ADHD based on the symptoms experienced. Moreover, in decision making, the CBR method looks for similarities to previous cases where there are many case data so that the level of similarity is high. In addition, the certainty factor can strengthen confidence and certainty so that the results are accurate.

            "ADHD (Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactive Disorder) is one of the behavioral disorders experienced by children. This disorder causes a person to have difficulty concentrating and behave excessively. Referring to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there are 3 types of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive impulsivity, and combination. The symptoms of ADHD appear before 12 years of age and last at least 6 months. Therefore, the role of parents is crucial to find out the presence of ADHD in children. The role of parents is significant in determining the presence of ADHD in children because 83.5% of children have a history of undiagnosed ADHD. This can have a bad impact in the future and cause symptoms that get worse over time. This paper proposes a screening tool for the early identification of ADHD in children using artificial intelligence. Using the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and certainty factor method can help identify the type of ADHD based on the symptoms experienced. Moreover, in decision making, the CBR method looks for similarities to previous cases where there are many case data so that the level of similarity is high. In addition, the certainty factor can strengthen confidence and certainty so that the results are accurate. Referring to the system created and the results of the tests that have been carried out, the accuracy value is 100%  \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

            "CONTEXT The ability of students to regulate their learning process is essential to the success of their education. This metacognitive ability is also called self-regulation of learning (SRL). The importance of SRL in education has been becoming a motivating factor for many researchers to develop the measurement model for students' SRL behaviour. One of the SRL measurement models in online learning is Online Self-regulated Learning Questionnaire (OSLQ), developed by Bernard et al.(2008). Several studies have tested, adapted and translated the OSLQ in different contexts. However, none of these studies assessed the OSLQ in online-collaborative learning environments, especially in Indonesia. PURPOSE The current study aims to assess the OSLQ measurement model's fitness in an Indonesian online collaborative learning environment. The result of this study will provide additional evidence to the validity of OSLQ as an instrument for measuring SRL in online learning, particularly for online collaborative learning. METHODS We collected questionnaire (Online Self-regulated Learning questionnaire) data from 277 students. We perform confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) through R studio software to assess the model's fitness to the data. As the indicators for the good of fitness of the model, we used several indices, like CFI, LTI, RMSEA, SRMR and Chisq\/df ratio. OUTCOMES Based on the result of CFA, we obtained the value for each index as follow, Chisq\/df = 1.66, CFI = 0.926, TLI= 0.914, RMSEA = 0.055, and SRMR = 0.065. All the indicators showed that the OSLQ model has the goodness of fit to the data. CONCLUSIONS Based on these findings, we can conclude that the OSLQ can be used d as a measurement model for online collaborative learning.

A parametric study is conducted to analyze the influence of variation in some design parameters on the system's performance.

This simulation uses On-Off Keying Non Return to Zero (OOK-NRZ) modulation technique with Line of Sight (LoS) channel model and the addition of optical concentrator in photodetector. Simulation is carried out at night conditions with interference from light emitted by another vehicle.

The four quality criteria, i.e. fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity, should be well balanced in order to produce proper process models which are aligned to the real-life executions. This paper proposes a method to optimize process discovery quality criteria (PDQC) by implementing different thresholds and analyzing calculation results using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Infrequent Inductive Miner algorithm. This paper sets up two experiments with different scenarios to measure the calculations of quality criteria and the quality of generated models. The experiments compare two SOPs to the process models discovered by Infrequent Inductive Miner algorithm; hence the SOPs serve as references to determine the generated models quality. The purpose of applying two different scenarios in the experiments is to discover how well the Infrequent Inductive Miner thresholds can produce predictive models under these two different scenarios circumstances. This paper has been successful in predicting the best-fit model in reference to the SOPs by optimizing the four quality criteria of process discovery using ROC thresholds settings and by using infrequent inductive miner algorithm for models generation, and also in improving the accuracy of models measurements. The accuracy rate of the prediction model from Experiment 1 is 83%, while Experiment 2 yields an accuracy rate of 88%.

            "Today, simulator technology has been widely used as an important part of quadrotor development such as validation and testing. A good quadrotor simulator can simulate the quadrotor system as closely as possible to the real one. Therefore, in case of multi-quadrotor simulator, the simulator should not only can simulate a multi-quadrotor system, but also every quadrotor should be able to leverage their own resources. To solve this issues, in this paper, we present a hypervisor-based multi-quadrotor simulator. We used RT-Xen as hypervisor, a real-time Xen hypervisor. To ensure every quadrotor runs in real-time manner, we implemented quadrotor simulator in Litmus-RT which is a real-time extension of Linux. In this paper, we conducted some testing and performance evaluation for particular cases on our multi-quadrotor simulator: step-input responses, computation time, and response times. Based on the performance evaluation, our hypervisor-based multi-quadrotor simulator environment is proven to meet the real-time requirements. The results show that three important tasks in quadrotor system: Stability Controllability Augmented System (SCAS), Equation of Motion (EOM), and waypoint following task, are finished before their deadlines; in fact, 20 ms, 10 ms, and 40 ms before the deadlines for SCAS, EOM, and waypoint following, respectively. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

            "Facial expression recognition (FER) serves as an essential tool for understanding human emotional behaviors. Facial expressions provide a wealth of information about intentions, emotions, and other inner states. Over the past two decades, the development of an automatic FER device has become one of the most demanding multimedia research areas in human\u2013computer interaction systems. Several automatic systems have been introduced and have achieved precise identification accuracies. Due to the complex nature of the human face, however, problems still exist. Researchers are still struggling to develop effective methods for extracting features from images because of unclear features. This work proposes a methodology that improves high-performance computing in terms of the facial expression recognition accuracy. To achieve the goal of high accuracy, a hybrid method is proposed using the dual-tree m-band wavelet transform (DTMBWT) algorithm based on energy, entropy, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). It is accompanied by the use of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the classification scheme to provide efficient identification of database images in terms of facial expressions. Using the DTMBWT, it is possible to derive many expression features from decomposition levels 1 to 6. Moreover, along with the GLCM features, the contrast and homogeneity features can be retrieved. All the features are eventually categorized and recognized with the aid of the GMM classifier. The proposed algorithms are tested using Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) database with seven different facial expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, neutral, surprise, and disgust. The results of the experiments show that the highest precision of the proposed technique is 99.53%, which is observed at the 4thdecomposition level of the DTMBWT. \u00a9 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

Using the DTMBWT, it is possible to derive many expression features from decomposition levels 1 to 6. Moreover, along with the GLCM features, the contrast and homogeneity features can be retrieved. All the features are eventually categorized and recognized with the aid of the GMM classifier. The proposed algorithms are tested using Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) database with seven different facial expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, neutral, surprise, and disgust. The results of the experiments show that the highest precision of the proposed technique is 99.53%, which is observed at the 4thdecomposition level of the DTMBWT. \u00a9 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

            "In an electronic nose (e-nose) system, the gas sensor array is the key component for detecting the volatile profile of a sample. An inappropriate sensor combination can lead to several issues, including overlapping selectivities, high computational overhead, performance degradation, etc. To deal with this problem, typically, a feature selection algorithm (FSA) is utilized to optimize the gas sensor combination in the sensor array. However, the instability of the FSA output is a serious problem in sensor array optimization. An unstable FSA output makes it difficult to conclude the general sensor combination. Hence, in this study, the Information-Theoretic Ensemble Feature Selection (ITEFS) method is proposed to deal with FSA instability. In the experiment, twelve homogeneous e-nose data sets were used that corresponded to twelve types of beef samples. Moreover, the outputs from eleven information-theoretic FSAs were aggregated to determine the general sensor combination. The performance of the selected sensors was validated based on the number of overlapping selectivities, F-measure, and execution time. The results indicated that ITEFS can more effectively reduce overlapping selectivities than other FSAs. The selected sensors also displayed comparable performance in classification tasks to other FSAs even when using fewer sensors, with an average F-measure of more than 99% using k-NN and SVM on all data sets. This indicates that the combination of selected sensors had sufficiently good generalization to detect the various types of beef samples. In addition, the utilization of a lower number of sensors also reduced the execution time in the training and testing processes.  \u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.",

Among the other common vital signs, a change in RR can be used as the first sign of deterioration and can avoid the possibility of missing the trends\u2019 identification as occurs in intermittent monitoring. Meanwhile some devices have experiences in false detection due to the different body motions. Hence, this study aims to develop a continuous RR monitoring with accuracy improvements using wearable sensors and data recording. In this RR monitoring work, we compared the performances of the flex sensor (2.2\u2033 in size) and the force-sensing resistor (FSR402) by placing them on the abdomen of a relaxing subject using a belt for 6\u00a0h every 10\u00a0min. The monitoring data were not only displayed on a smartphone but also stored on firebase platform. The system therefore took the advantages of a web service architecture to send, retrieve, and access data from the cloud. The comparison results of the flex and the FSR402 sensors due to the average RR differences (and the mean average error) compared to the breath manual count are 0.30\u00a0bpm (0.90\u00a0bpm) and 1.45\u00a0bpm (2.25\u00a0bpm), respectively. In this study, we show a way to improve the sensor performance by automatically adjusting the sensitivity of the strain sensors for adapting the RR measurement on abdomen of the test subject. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the system is able to measure and fast transmit the RR data as the monitoring process using the IoT Firebase platform and that the performance of the flex sensor provides the possibility of further development and improvement in obtaining much better result. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

The use of TLS in the MQTT protocol does not suitable for constraint devices. One of the vulnerabilities encountered in the MQTT protocol is authentication.

            "\u2013 The generator scheduling problem seems simple, i.e., the demand should be met by generators that have been installed. On the other hand, fuel costs optimization is quite challenging. Under certain conditions, e.g., at the lowest load, generating capacity can exceed the demand when all the generators are operated. Thus, some generators should be turned off in order to minimize fuel costs. In this case, unit commitment is one of the interesting issues to be studied. It can reduce fuel costs and transmission losses in accordance with the generator power composition and location. This paper proposes a method that considers unit commitment in the optimization processes quickly and accurately. It will be considered in determining generator scheduling. The optimization process starts with the temporary results based on the direct method. The temporary results will determine whether the generator is on or off by considering the generator limits. At the same time, transmission losses will be evaluated with the B-Loss Matrix once the final results are obtained. This method has been tested with 26 buses and six generators with satisfactory results. Although the transmission losses have increased by 122.8% (i.e., increase of 64.422 MW, from 281.739 MW to 346.161 MW) compared to the results without unit commitment, the fuel costs have fallen to 85.24% (i.e., from $417,996.5 to $356,294.2) of all the generators stated commit. \u00a9 2021 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.",

            "Diabetes is a disease that causes abnormally high glucose levels in the blood and is considered the main factor of damage to blood vessels. This disease can affect the heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves and cause various complications. The risks of diabetes can be reduced with proper treatment in the early stage. Early identification of diabetes can be made by implementing a machine learning model to predict or diagnose diabetes. In this study, we utilized Random Forest (RF) to develop a classification model to predict people with diabetes. Random Forest is known as an ensemble method that combines the prediction of each basic model. The model development was performed by using drug reviews content retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The data set consists of the review and confirmed patient condition. We performed preprocessing step to obtain the important feature from the text. Then the feature extraction was done by using N-gram and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). We utilized six N-gram methods, i.e., unigram, bigram, trigram, unigram-bigram, bigram-trigram, and unigram-big ram-trigram. The best result of the experiments is obtained from the model developed by using a unigram feature with F-1 score is 0.952.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

The NCD was constructed from a tungsten needle and grounded mesh electrode in the needle-to-plane configuration. The dual NCD created a bipolar ion environment by mixing the balanced concentration of positive and negative ions produced by each NCD. The dual NCD was placed in an electrospray aerosol generator (EAG) apparatus to reduce the charge state of the ES particles. Polystyrene latex (PSL) suspensions having the particle size range of 96\u2013256 nm were used as the precursor solution for the electrospray process. Some characterizations to the NCD were carried out to obtain optimum operating voltage and air flow rate. The size distribution and charge fraction of the electrospray PSL (ES-PSL) particles exiting the EAG were also investigated. The result showed the dual NCD could generate stable bipolar ions by mixing positive and negative ions with balanced concentration.

Measuring usability helps determine how usable (e.g., effective, efficient, easy to learn) the system from users' perspective, determine whether any issues need to be fixed, and monitor the performance of the system design over time.

One of the major issues with the installation of a hybrid-access mechanism in small-cells is the cross-tier interference (intercell interference (ICI)) caused by the macrocell users (MUs) that are unable to establish a connection to the small-cell base station (SBS). In this paper, a joint strategy is proposed for hybrid-access small-cells using the Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform (WHT) with NOMA and interference rejection combining (IRC) to achieve high performance gains and mitigate intercell interference (ICI), respectively. WHT is applied mathematically as an orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) to achieve diversity in communication systems. When applied jointly with NOMA, it ensures better performance gains than the conventional NOMA. It reduces the bit error rate (BER) and enhances subsequent throughput performance of the system.

Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer is highly needed because treatment choices are decided and the period of survival is heavily affected. This paper proposes the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting four classes of colon cancer. The data-set consists of 2500 images, divided into Tumor, Complex, Lymphoma and Stroma. This data set represents a selection from the Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg, Germany, consist of 150 \u00d7 150 px textures in histological pictures. The proposed system consist of two hidden convolutional layers, a fully connected layer and use Adam Optimizer with learning 0.001, and trained 10 times (epochs = 10). The result of the proposed system is 83% accuracy. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

Software-Defined Network (SDN) has advantages in controlling the network which can be exploited with various load balancing strategies that are used to distribute traffic loads to improve overall system performance. The Performance for load balancing can be improved by selecting the server with minimum load using the Fuzzy Logic Algorithm. Traditional load balancing lacked the usage of device state data. In this study, an SDN-based Server Load Balancing method using fuzzy logic methods has been performed. Fuzzy Algorithm successfully delivers HTTP requests to lowest load server based on Distribution Server Index. In the testing, the server load must be directed at the lowest server weight so that each server should not be overloaded. In testing with a request load ranging from 100 - 500, the Fuzzy algorithm imposes more traffic distribution on the 3rd Server with the lowest server load. In the CPU usage test, the fuzzy logic algorithm has the lowest average value namely 39%. In the RAM usage test, the fuzzy logic algorithm has the lowest average value namely 54%. In the throughput test, the fuzzy logic algorithm has the highest average value namely 2KBps. The Fairness Index of Fuzzy Logic is 0.45 while Round Robin's fairness index is 0.99.

However, after rice passing a certain shelf-life time limit, it is no longer fit for consumption nor sale. Conventionally, sample rice is taken from storage periodically to monitor its quality, relying heavily on human judgment in its process. To automate this, we proposed the method to predict rice shelf life to use a machine learning Support Vector Regression (SVR) based on the electronic nose (e-nose) dataset. Hence, the contribution of this study is using SVR to predict rice shelf-life based on the electronic nose signals. This study used the SVR model with two parameters, namely C and Gamma, and utilized the min-max data normalization method in its preprocessing stage. In terms of prediction accuracy, the results are evaluated using R{2} dan RMSE.

The four quality criteria, i.e. fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity, should be well balanced in order to produce proper process models which are aligned to the real-life executions. This paper proposes a method to optimize process discovery quality criteria (PDQC) by implementing different thresholds and analyzing calculation results using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Infrequent Inductive Miner algorithm. This paper sets up two experiments with different scenarios to measure the calculations of quality criteria and the quality of generated models. The experiments compare two SOPs to the process models discovered by Infrequent Inductive Miner algorithm; hence the SOPs serve as references to determine the generated models quality. The purpose of applying two different scenarios in the experiments is to discover how well the Infrequent Inductive Miner thresholds can produce predictive models under these two different scenarios circumstances. This paper has been successful in predicting the best-fit model in reference to the SOPs by optimizing the four quality criteria of process discovery using ROC thresholds settings and by using infrequent inductive miner algorithm for models generation, and also in improving the accuracy of models measurements. The accuracy rate of the prediction model from Experiment 1 is 83%, while Experiment 2 yields an accuracy rate of 88%.

            "The tourism sector utilizes information and communication technology in promoting Indonesian tourism so tourists can obtain information about Indonesian tourism through websites, one of which is Tripadvisor. As one of the marine tourism spots in Indonesia, Bali uses the review from Tripadvisor web in developing, evaluating, and promoting its tourist attractions. However, there is a discrepancy between the rating and the review given by the user, and the review contains a paradoxical figure of speech in one review. This study is about a sentiment analysis on reviews of the five most favorite beaches in Bali: Double Six, Seminyak, Nusa Dua, Kelingking, and Canggu, using the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the Tripadvisor website. By approaching in 4 steps: preprocessing data (word stemming, lemmatization, data labeling, tokenization), TF-IDF weighting, classification using RNN, and performance evaluation. The result of sentiment analysis is that positive labels dominate. This study also calculated the value of precision, recall, F1-Score, and ROC curve for each beach. The accuracy gets more than 80%. ROC curve is classified as 'Fair Classification' and 'Good classification' with AUC values between 0.71-0.87. This proves that RNN has good performance and accuracy in performing sentiment analysis on reviews of the five most favorite beaches in Bali. \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

            "Dialect is a variation of the language used by a group of people, sometimes in a particular region. It plays an essential role in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In general, an ASR gives high accuracy for a dialect-specific case, but it obtains a low accuracy for the multi-dialect application, such as for the Indonesian language that has hundreds of dialects. In this research, a system to recognize various dialects in Indonesia is developed. First, an utterance is preprocessed using both normalization and framing. Second, its features are then extracted using the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC), which is one of the feature extraction methods for the best acoustic signals. Finally, a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) is used to learn and classify dialect characteristics. Evaluation of the dataset of five major dialects in Indonesia shows that the greater the Epoch and Bath Size, the greater the accuracy produced by the DRNN. However, accuracy is not directly proportional to the value of both parameters. The Epoch of 30 and Batch Size of 30 are the optimum parameters that yield the highest accuracy of 87.0% for the training set. Evaluation of the testing set shows that it gives an accuracy of 85.4% for the unseen dialects.  \u00a9 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

            "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to design a research model and analyze the relationship between open innovation and cleaner production. The paper maps and characterizes the conditions of open innovation against cleaner production in Indonesian batik small and medium enterprise (SME), particularly in Java and Madura. The mapping process is executed by classifying the batik SME into four quadrants. The diagram is a quadrant in which there are four parts to distinguish each of the ability of batik SMEs in understanding and achieving cleaner production through open innovation. This research will obtain a new method or model that can be applied by organizations to achieve cleaner production through an open innovation. The data is obtained from 182 batik SMEs located in Laweyan, Madura and Lasem (in Java Island, Indonesia). Design\/methodology\/approach: One of the problems in batik SME is the waste management from the dyeing and wax removal process. In the first stages of this research, a number of initial models were elaborated as a reference, then the results of the elaboration became a new research model. The research model that has been produced is then tested using data from respondents. Based on the test results, the model can be stated valid or not. In this study, the model is valid after testing data from 182 respondents, because all outer loading for all indicators is above 0.7. The composite reliability and AVE values of all constructs were above 0.7 and 0.5. Based on the validated research model, the data is statistically processed by using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). By using the SEM method and statistical software SMART PLS 3.0this research can be supported to achieve the research objectives. Findings: Based on data testing and processing, open innovation climate could predict a sustained relationship to open innovation with an accuracy rate of 0.466 and influence rate of 0.427, whereas open innovation could predict a sustained relationship to cleaner production with an accuracy rate of 0.183 and influence rate of 0.324. The relationships between open innovation climate and open innovation; including open innovation toward cleaner production, are statistically significant because all prediction values and accuracy in the model have met the criteria for measurement parameters based on the value of R2, p value and T-statistics to be stated as a significant relationship. Research limitations\/implications: This research provides an overview of the influence and importance of open innovation in creating an environmentally friendly production process in the context of cleaner production. Cleaner production on batik SMEs can be achieved through open innovation, both for inbound open innovation and outbound open innovation. Open innovation comprehensively provides support for batik SMEs in achieving cleaner production. Open innovation can be run well and optimally if it gets support from a conducive climate open innovation. Furthermore, the implementation of cleaner production could be a guideline for the owner to minimize the waste from batik SME production, both for natural and synthetic dyes. Some limitations in these study include the absence of influence from the existing stakeholders on batik SMEs on the implementation process of open innovation; the use of the cross-sectional approach that results in the unavailability of further analysis regarding the dynamics or improvements that occur in attaining cleaner production through open innovation; and finally providing no analysis of the differences in characteristics at each location of batik SMEs. Originality\/value: The implementation of cleaner production model is considered as one of the new methods and references in conjunction with reducing the negative impact of waste toward the environment, particularly in the traditional textile industry which is limited in waste management capability. \u00a9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

            "Corn yield improvement program aims to attain continuous national self-sufficiency. The program needs to be supported by the availability of food resources, including high-quality corn seeds. In corn seed production, grading is one of the factors that affect the quality of corn seeds. The grading process is conducted manually by visual observations of workers. This process tends to be subjective and ineffective. Some corn seed factories use sieve machines to do grading by seed size. In this paper, an imaging-based classification system is proposed to perform corn seeds (BIMA-20 URI Hybrid) grading of two classes, which are categorised as good and bad. Three different methods are studied in the paper. The methods are respectively based on (1) shape, colour, and size features, (2) seed roundness, and (3) deep learning approach. Images data is acquired in a group of five corn kernels. Region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation is performed to select every single seed from the group image. Features values are then extracted from a single seed image and used as a classification parameter. The F1score of the proposed classification system, roundness differentiation, and model training performance can be used to show the categorisation capability. The deep learning approach has achieved the best F1score among the other proposed techniques. The best F1value, 0.983, is obtained at the ResNet-50 implementation. In separated observation, Method 6 (Size and Colour), Method 7 (Size, Shape, and Colour), Roundness, and ResNet-50 are represented as the best model for each group method. These methods reach F1scores more than 0.9, except the roundness parameter. The F1score of the roundness parameter is found at 0.854.

In this study, we investigate the effect of uniaxial strain on the electronic properties of MoS2 monolayer using first-principles calculations. Results show that a crossover of the K-K direct to \u0393-K indirect bandgap transitions occurs at a strain of 1.743%. Moreover, a strong correlation is observed between the modified bandgap and the density of states (DOS) of the Mo-4d and S-3p orbitals at the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum. The uniaxial strain-tuned interatomic distance along the a-crystallographic axis not only alters the bandgap at different rates but also affects the DOS of the Mo-4d orbital and possible electronic transitions. This study clarifies the mechanism of the electronic structural modification of two-dimensional MoS2 monolayer, which may affect intervalley transitions. \u00a9 2022 Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology.",

In this study, the author builds a clustering controller using the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) controller on an Software Defined Network (SDN) network. ONOS has a cluster feature that allows it to distribute traffic loads to other controllers to increase performance. The performance of clustering controller is compared with single controller and multi controller without clustering by measuring Quality of Service (QoS) on delay, jitter, and throughput parameters for data, voice, and video services. The test is done by adding background traffic. After being tested and analyzed, the performance of the clustering controller has the most superior QoS with an average delay in data services of 0.047026667 ms, jitter of 0.015414943 ms, throughput of 37.56360736 kbit\/s.

The performance of clustering controller is compared with single controller and multi controller without clustering by measuring Quality of Service (QoS) on delay, jitter, and throughput parameters for data, voice, and video services. The test is done by adding background traffic. After being tested and analyzed, the performance of the clustering controller has the most superior QoS with an average delay in data services of 0.047026667 ms, jitter of 0.015414943 ms, throughput of 37.56360736 kbit\/s. In the voice service, the delay value is 0.03909 ms, the jitter is 0.01828 ms, the throughput is 72.79049 kbit\/s. In the video service, the delay value is 0,12072 ms, the jitter is 0,042013 ms, and the throughput is 5314,059 kbit\/s. While in single and multi controller the average value obtained is not much different from the clustering controller. This is due to the single controller architecture, the network control center is only centered on 1 controller, as well as multi controllers, so that it affects the performance of service distribution. \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

            "Background and objectives: The impacts of COVID-19 are like two sides of one coin. During 2020, there were many research papers that proved our environmental and climate conditions were improving due to lockdown or large-scale restriction regulations. In contrast, the economic conditions deteriorated due to disruption in industry business activities and most people stayed at home and worked from home, which probably reduced the noise pollution. Methods: To assess whether there were differences in noise pollution before and during COVID-19. In this paper, we use various statistical methods following odds ratios, Wilcoxon and Fisher\u2019s tests and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with various comparisons of prior selection. The outcome of interest for a parameter in Bayesian inference is complete posterior distribution. Roughly, the mean of the posterior will be clear with point approximation. That being said, the median is an available choice. Findings: To make the Bayesian MCMC work, we ran the sampling from the conditional posterior distributions. It is straightforward to draw random samples from these distributions if they have regular shapes using MCMC. The case of over-standard noise per time frame, number of noise petition cases, number of industry petition cases, number of motorcycles, number of cars and density of vehicles are significant at \u03b1=5%. In line with this, we prove that there were differences of noise pollution before and during COVID-19 in Taiwan.

During New Normal, activities can still run by implementing health protocols by requiring masks to be worn. Currently, the detection of masks is still done manually by security officers because of the fatigue factor, so that human errors often occur. To overcome this, an automatic system is needed to detect people wearing masks and not wearing masks. In this study, a mask detection system was made using the haar cascade classifier method by utilizing machine learning, image processing, and the internet to facilitate connectivity.

The resulting performance is when the video stream reaches 12-60 fps, the system can run well without stuttering even during the video stream.

Thus, many researchers have proposed methodologies to monitor the activity of the elderly. The monitoring system can detect when falling occurs and alert the people responsible to help them as soon as possible. The monitoring system was built based on few types of sensors such as wearable devices and video-based monitoring systems. This study was aimed to build a video-based monitoring system for falling detection for the elderly by using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our CNN model can predict the falling occurrence with an accuracy of 96.67% and with an F1 Score of 92.30%. In conclusion, the CNN model can be utilized to detect the falling occurrence of the elderly in real-time with a very good accuracy.

In this work, we propose a novel algorithm, making use of angular resolutions and convolutional neural networks for 3D object recognition, and it collects image shapes or contours from real objects by placing them on a rotating display to record the appearances from multiple angular views. The chosen angular resolution is in the range of 0-180 degrees, and the selection of viewing angle is done by a binary search. We have conducted a comparative experiment on the accuracy of 6 well-known network architectures, including GoogleNet, CaffeNet, SqueezeNet, ResNet18, ResNet32, and ResNet50, to see how far these architecture networks can adapt to the angular resolution techniques that we propose for the classification of objects outside the lab environment.

The common practice to generate phrase tables in pivot approaches is to use standard symmetrization, i.e., grow-diag-final-and. Although some researchers found that the use of non-standard symmetrization could improve bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores, the use of non-standard symmetrization has not been commonly employed in pivot approaches. In this study, we propose a strategy that uses the non-standard symmetrization of word alignment in phrase table combination. The appropriate symmetrization is selected based on the highest BLEU scores in each direct translation of source\u2013target, source\u2013pivot, and pivot\u2013target of Kazakh\u2013English (Kk\u2013En) and Japanese\u2013Indonesian (Ja\u2013Id). Our experiments show that our proposed strategy outperforms the direct translation in Kk\u2013En with absolute improvements of 0.35 (a 11.3% relative improvement) and 0.22 (a 6.4% relative improvement) BLEU points for 3-gram and 5-gram, respectively. The proposed strategy shows an absolute gain of up to 0.11 (a 0.9% relative improvement) BLEU points compared to direct translation for 3-gram in Ja\u2013Id. Our proposed strategy using a small phrase table obtains better BLEU scores than a strategy using a large phrase table.

Although some researchers found that the use of non-standard symmetrization could improve bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores, the use of non-standard symmetrization has not been commonly employed in pivot approaches. In this study, we propose a strategy that uses the non-standard symmetrization of word alignment in phrase table combination. The appropriate symmetrization is selected based on the highest BLEU scores in each direct translation of source\u2013target, source\u2013pivot, and pivot\u2013target of Kazakh\u2013English (Kk\u2013En) and Japanese\u2013Indonesian (Ja\u2013Id). Our experiments show that our proposed strategy outperforms the direct translation in Kk\u2013En with absolute improvements of 0.35 (a 11.3% relative improvement) and 0.22 (a 6.4% relative improvement) BLEU points for 3-gram and 5-gram, respectively. The proposed strategy shows an absolute gain of up to 0.11 (a 0.9% relative improvement) BLEU points compared to direct translation for 3-gram in Ja\u2013Id. Our proposed strategy using a small phrase table obtains better BLEU scores than a strategy using a large phrase table. The size of the target monolingual and feature function weight of the language model (LM) could reduce perplexity scores. \u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

However, the complex behaviors of resilient project leaders, especially in post-failure conditions, have been largely overlooked. To address this critical research gap, the present study identifies the direct relationships between three potential behavioral traits of project leaders (i.e., resilience, self-esteem, and self-efficacy) and examines how they move forward beyond project failures.

The 5G and other services are mandatory, supported by a large mobile backhaul capacity. 10-Gigabit-capable symmetric passive optical network (XGS-PON) has the potential to resolve this issue because it can deliver 10 Gbps upstream and downstream simultaneously. This study evaluates the XGS-PON's performance to implement mobile backhaul in a cellular network in Indonesia. This paper proposes a method for ONT testing that is implemented for mobile backhaul. This test method supports the evaluation of device performance in the physical layer and data link layer. The testing results confirmed that XGS-PON ONT supported mobile backhaul with a nominal rate of 9.65296 Gbps, an operating wavelength of 1269.509 nm, launch power 5.63 dBm, sensitivity -26.64 dBm, and overload -5.92 dBm. The functionality test shows that the XGS-PON ONT supports jumbo frames of 2000-9000 bytes, 4096 VLAN IDs, forward VLAN tagging, and un-tagging transparently passes the desired tagging VLANs. The IEEE 1588v2 synchronization test results show that time Synch Accuracy is 53 ns, and sync-e is 0.058 ppb for frequency offset. In conclusion, all test results have complied with ITU-T G.9807, IEEE 802.1q, and Broadband Forum technical reports except for sensitivity results that have not met the specification value of -28 dBm.

IDC Diagnosis requires extremely serious measures, such as surgery and radiation therapy.

We analyzed the changes in the concentrations of outdoor air pollutants before lockdown from January 1 to April 9, 2020, and during lockdown from April 10 to June 4, 2020. Overall, the CO concentration (39.9%) demonstrated the most significant reduction during lockdown, followed by NO2(7.5%) and then SO2(5.7%). However, we unexpectedly found that during lockdown, the PM10concentration in Jakarta increased by 10.9% due to the southwest monsoon during the seasonal change in Jakarta. Among the five cities in Jakarta, East and Central Jakarta experienced the maximum improvement in their air quality, whereas North Jakarta had the least air quality improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to study the effect of lockdown on outdoor air quality improvement in Indonesia using ground-level measurement data. The findings of the study provide additional strategies to the regulatory bodies for the reduction of temporal air pollutants in Jakarta, Indonesia, by restricting people mobility as a supplementary initiative. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.",

In addition, privacy and confidentiality are also major challenges in handling. A robust hybrid based on speeded-up robust features (SURF), discrete cosine transform (DCT), singular value decomposition or SVD, and chaotic (Arnold's Cat Map) scheme is proposed in this paper. The use of chaotic maps is for watermarking medical images, which can provide protection and security on medical images. In the watermark image, a method is applied that will increase the security of the watermark image, namely Arnold's Cat Maps. SVD method is used to decompose input data into three submatrices. To produce a watermarked image by combining the watermark image and the host image with the SURF-DCT-SVD method, the embedding stage is carried out. At the extraction stage, it will produce a watermark image from the watermarked image. Furthermore, various attacks were carried out against the proposed method. Experimental results show SVD can increase the robustness of DCT and SURF-based watermarking schemes. The proposed watermarking technique is resistant to JPEG compression attacks, noise addition, signal processing, and geometry attacks. In addition, the other state-of-the-art techniques are compared to the performance of the proposed method.

Hence, data normalization and missing value handling are considered the major problems in the data pre-processing stage, while classification algorithms are adopted to handle numerical features. In cases where the observed data contained outliers, the missing value estimated results are sometimes unreliable or even differ greatly from the true values. Therefore, this study aims to propose the combination of normalization and outlier removals before imputing missing values on the class center-based firefly algorithm method (ON + C3FA). Moreover, some standard imputation techniques like mean, a random value, regression, as well as multiple imputation, KNN imputation, and decision tree (DT)-based missing value imputation were utilized as a comparison of the proposed method. Experimental results on the sonar dataset showed normalization and outlier removals effect in the methods.

The data were collected during the periods of Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) and Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) from October 11 to December 31, 2020. Data collection was completed through an online questionnaire survey conducted among a sample of 432 enterprises from four industrial sectors, namely services, retail, manufacturing, and tourism, in all states in Malaysia. The sample was selected using cluster and systematic random sampling. The questionnaire asked respondents to state whether they used the Internet, computers, phones, web sites, e-payment, and e-commerce to complete their activities relating to finance, production and operations, human resource management, and marketing. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and cross-tabulation. The data show the extent of digital adoption by Malaysian enterprises during the pandemic in comparison to the situation before the pandemic.

Fire detection using video surveillance as input is much more efficient than fire sensors because of the broader coverage area and is relatively cheaper. Several previous studies used handcrafted features as a differentiator between fire and other objects. Features like color, texture, and motion can be used as a reference for detecting fire. Object detection techniques using video as input are overgrowing. Some researchers use deep learning architecture to detect objects from video input. The deep learning architecture is capable of extracting features directly from video input by leveraging neural network layers. This study tries to compare several deep learning methods for fire detection from video input. The methods compared are Faster RCNN, Yolov4, and Yolov5. After being evaluated, the method with the best True Positive Rate is Yolov4 with a value of 84.62%, while the method with the best True Negative Rate value is Yolov5 with a value of 97.06%. Yolov5 is also the method with the best computational time that is 23.26 FPS. Faster RCNN got an excellent positive rate, almost close to the positive rate of Yolov4 and Yolov5. However, the negative rate of Faster RCNN is quite alarming. The computation time required is also longer than Yolov4 and Yolov5. \u00a9 2021 ACM.",

The development of chatbots evolved rapidly to efficiently collect information in numerous fields, including customer service, health care, and etc. However, there was limited discussion of how chatbots are used to conduct an interview process autonomously. A human-driven interview also has some major limitations, e.g., it may only be conducted on a small-scale and is susceptible to bias. Hence, this study provides the design of a chatbot to conduct an interview, as well as processing the interview result by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) or machine learning. We have identified the difference between the typical chatbot communication method and the interview bot. This finding can be an opportunity to make a new interview bot or improve the implementation of a chatbot.

The development of chatbots evolved rapidly to efficiently collect information in numerous fields, including customer service, health care, and etc. However, there was limited discussion of how chatbots are used to conduct an interview process autonomously. A human-driven interview also has some major limitations, e.g., it may only be conducted on a small-scale and is susceptible to bias. Hence, this study provides the design of a chatbot to conduct an interview, as well as processing the interview result by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) or machine learning. We have identified the difference between the typical chatbot communication method and the interview bot. This finding can be an opportunity to make a new interview bot or improve the implementation of a chatbot. In the end, we also discuss the challenges and benefits of the development of an interview bot. \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

The standard of graduates' profiles that can be used as an assessment is the waiting period. The ideal target of a waiting period is less than or equal to three months. The competence of graduates who can compete in the world of work becomes an assessment of the quality of a university. Several factors that affect the waiting period are the Grade Point Average (GPA), study period, and students' organization activity. This research was conducted to create a waiting period prediction model using a decision tree based on the factors that affect it. To analyze the waiting period prediction results, the accuracy of the model and the decision tree model is good or not based on the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The decision tree is one of the data mining techniques that can be used for decision-making. In this research, we will use the CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm. In the data mining classification process, data pre-processing will be carried out first, after that the splitting data (training and testing data) will be carried out. Based on the results of the classification tree, the tree size is 10 and has 10 rules.

            "Semantic segmentation has become one of the trending topics in the world of computer vision and deep learning. Recently, due to an increasing demand to solve a semantic segmentation task simultaneously with attribute recognition of objects, a new task named attribute-aware semantic segmentation has been introduced. Since the task requires to handle pixel-wise object class estimation with its attributes such as a pedestrian's body orientation, previous works had difficulties to handle ambiguous attributes such as body orientations in object-level, especially when segmenting the pedestrians with their attributes correctly. This paper proposes the ColAtt-Net that is an attribute-aware semantic segmentation model augmented by a column-wise mask branch to predict the pedestrians' orientations in the horizontal perspective of the input image. We firmly assume that the pedestrians captured by a car-mounted camera are distributed horizontally so that for each column of the input image, the pedestrian pixels can be labeled with one orientation uniformly. In the proposed method, we split the output of the base semantic segmentation model into two branches; one branch for segmenting the object categories, while the other one, as the novel column-wise attribute branch, is to map the recognition of pedestrian's orientations that are distributed horizontally. This method successfully enhances the performance of attribute-aware semantic segmentation by reducing the ambiguity on segmenting the pedestrian's orientation. Improvements on the pedestrian orientation segmentation are confidently shown by the proposed method in the experimental results, both in quantitative and qualitative views.

The question is whether and how far has the current telemedicine system has addressed accessibility in its application design. Halodoc is a well-known telemedicine system in Indonesia. In this research, we tested Halodoc mobile application's accessibility using two methods: scanner test using Accessibility Scanner tool and user test. From the scanner test, many accessibility issues are found, such as small touch targets, insufficient text, and poor image contrasts. From the user tests, we observed that users needed more than two minutes to finish a task.

One of the things that are influenced by hormones is sweat. The odor of sweat is related to the apocrine glands found in human armpits. This experiment studied the classification of both genders based on daytime sweat in adult human armpits. The sampling method used an electronic nose (E-nose) system to collect the armpit sweat odor. The E-nose system sensor array consisted of seven sensors: TGS 822, TGS 2612, TGS 2620, TGS 826, TGS 2603, TGS 2600, and TGS 813. These sensors generate resistance ratio (Rs\/Ro) values which are learned by the machine learning methods for classification and disease potential based on the volatile organic compound (VOC) in sweat. The study shows the male samples have higher amine gas than female samples, one of which is Trimethylamine (TMA). TMA is a compound that will be broken down into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a factor to various cardiovascular diseases.

The contemporary concept of EEB has been embraced by many organi-sations and attracted scholars\u2019 attention worldwide. Nevertheless, studies that explored challenges and solutions for performing EEB at the workplace are scarce. This study explored challenges and solutions in performing EEB at the workplace and focused on qualitative research methodology. The researchers interviewed 24 academicians from five leading green research Malaysian universi-ties. Valuable qualitative data and numerous challenges such as high costs of practising, lack of infrastructure, top management support, environmental attitude, green mindfulness, enforcement, and monitoring were identified as challenges in applying EEB from the interviews. Stringent rules and regulations, monitoring, training programmes, and monetary incentives might be efficient solutions to apply ecological behaviour at workplaces, specifically universities. In conclusion, this study has discovered the challenges and solutions in implementing EEB for a sustainable workplace by interviewing academicians from different departments of selected Malaysian higher educational institutes. Also, poor infrastructure, high cost, and the lack of top management support, environmental attitude, green mindfulness, enforcement, and monitoring were identified as the primary challenges in performing EEB. Additionally, the research also discovered significant suggestions to resolve the challenges when implementing EEB at the workplace, such as strict rules and regula-tions, training programmes, incentives, monitoring, and communicating change and campaigns.

Two SNPs, g.396C\/T and g.399C\/G, were discovered in the 5'UTR region based on sequence alignment (position number based on Genbank acc no. NC_040274). For both SNPs, only two genotypes were found in the samples. Both SNPs had identical allele and genotype frequencies. The C allele (86%, n=26) was higher than the T (g.396C\/T) and G allele (g.399C\/G) (14%, n=10). The homozygous CC genotype has a higher frequency (72%) in both SNP g.396C\/T and g.399C\/G, followed by CT and CG genotype (28%), respectively. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis resulted in the sample population did not deviate (\u03c72<5.59). Further analysis could be suggested to provide an overview of this polymorphism effect in Garut sheep's growth traits. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

            "The growth of gas emissions (GE) in the environment that stirred climate change, has correlated with the decline of fossil fuels. Generally, GE was produced by burning fossil fuels such as gasoline in the combustion engine. Gasoline has higher air toxic emissions than ethanol. Hence, the investigation of ethanol has gained attention. On the other hand, biomass has become a renewable source of ethanol. However, due to the rigid structure of biomass, biomass pretreatment is needed before the hydrolysis and fermentation process. Recently, growing attention has been devoted to applying ionic liquids (ILs)-assisted pretreatment despite the high-cost process. Therefore, in this study, to optimize the ethanol production from biomass, the simulation using SuperPro Designer (SPD) software was conducted. Bagasse as biomass material was treated by IL, namely choline acetate (ChOAc), with the range of ratio IL\/biomass of 0-1.5. The developed SPD model was validated with published data. The results indicated that the minimum ratio of IL\/biomass was 1.3. When in the hydrolysis performed at high-loading after 72 h reaction time, the glucose and xylose concentrations were 49 g\/L and 13 g\/L, respectively. When the fermentation process was conducted, the initial mixed sugar solution concentration was 23 g\/L of glucose and 6 g\/L of xylose. Then, the ethanol concentration was 15 g\/L at 24 h, which was 89% of the theoretical ethanol yield. To conclude, the developed SPD model not only could support to optimize the biomass refinery into low GE of ethanol but also could reduce large cost experimental.  \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In this study, it was focused on the problem that silhouette data has edge information but does not have texture information. Since popular algorithms for optical flow calculation do not work well on the problem, a method was proposed in this study. It artificially enriches the texture information of silhouette images by drawing shrunk edge on the inside of it with a different color. By the additional texture information, it was expected to give a clue of calculating better optical flows to popular optical flow calculation algorithms. Through the experiments using 10 videos of animals from the DAVIS 2016 dataset and TV-L1 algorithm for dense optical flow calculation, two values of errors (MEPE and AAE) were evaluated and it was revealed that the proposed method improved the performance of optical flow calculation for various videos.

In this paper, we review these fundamental limitations of Huygens' metasurfaces and show how the bandwidth may be optimized within the constraints of single resonance meta-atoms.

            "The construction sector carries out various business activities, ranging from procurement of construction materials, production of building materials and materials, transportation and distribution of materials and materials, as well as the design of building projects or other infrastructure facilities. Of the various activities in the construction sector, each activity can have an impact on the environment. Sustainability supply chain (SSCM) is a concept in the supply chain process that pays attention to three aspects, namely social, economic, and environmental in carrying out supply chain activities. This SSCM concept integrates these three aspects to obtain a sustainable supply chain process. Evaluation of material management activities, especially social and environmental aspects in the supply chain, can be measured through a supply chain performance sustainability approach. This study uses the Sustainable Balanced Scorecard model to map the supply chain strategy and the Supply Chain Operational Reference model to map business processes and determine metrics and ISO 14001 as a clause for the work environment. Based on the integration of the two models, a performance measurement metric is obtained which is used as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) in measuring a sustainable supply chain. Based on the perspective of the BSC model, the research in this research uses three BSC perspectives, namely the financial perspective, the internal business process perspective, and the learning and growth perspective. These three perspectives were chosen based on the company's material management business processes. All company strategies that have been mapped into the previous BSC perspective are remapped with an overview of the relationship between strategies across perspectives. The priority vector shows the weight of each criterion from the matrix. In the financial perspective indicators, weighting is not carried out because the indicators in the financial perspective are not compared to the PCJM questionnaire. The criteria assessment is said to be consistent if the value of the Consistency Ratio is the Consistency Index divided by the Random Index 0.1. Based on the results of the consistency test, it is known that the value of the importance scale is fairly consistent because the entire consistency ratio value is less than 0.1. This research obtains 20 KPIs, which are divided into financial, internal business process and learning growth perspectives.

            "The development of the broiler poultry industry has experienced a significant increase along with the increasing public demand for meat consumption. However, in 2019, many broiler poultry farmers are forced to close down their businesses because the price of broilers in living conditions continues to be belowthe Production Cost. Further, broiler poultry farmers also experience obstacles including unpredictable price fluctuations and intense competition. Innovation ambidexterity is the innovation capability in managing exploration and exploitation simultaneously to improve firm performance. Several influential factors in increasing innovation ambidexterity include technological capability, owner-manager characteristic, and environmental dynamism. This study aims to develop a model that describes innovation ambidexterity in broiler poultry farmers to improve firm performance. This study also analyzes the factors that can influence innovation ambidexterity and its effect on firm performance. This research mainly uses quantitative methods for its analysis. The sampling technique uses non-probability sampling with convenience sampling technique. Data collection was conducted by distributing 223 questionnaires to broiler poultry farmers in West Java. The analysis technique uses Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) which includes measurement model analysis and structural model analysis. The results of this study indicate that innovation ambidexterity has a direct influence on firm performance, while the influence of environmental dynamism on firm performance is partly mediated by innovation ambidexterity. In addition, technological capability and owner-manager characteristics have a positive influence on innovation ambidexterity and have an indirect influence on firm performance.

Therefore, several conditions need to be considered, namely the pH value of the water, the value of the nutrient solution, and the circulating water pump. Manually controlling water and environmental conditions will consume a lot of time and energy and is susceptible to human measurement errors. So it is necessary to design an integrated control system on hydroponic plants, including a water pH control system and a nutrient solution control system. This system uses several components, including a pH sensor, EC (Electrical Conductivity) sensor, Mega 2560 Pro as a microcontroller, a 4V 5 channel relay, and a peristaltic pump as an actuator that will move to remove pH-up, pH-down, and AB-mix nutrients. This system is also based on the Internet of Things (IoT), where data obtained from pH sensors and EC sensors will be processed by a microcontroller and then sent to the IoT Antares platform via the available communication modules. Data is stored on Antares's cloud server to be displayed in a User Interface to the user. Based on the test results, the monitoring and integrated control systems for hydroponic plants have been successfully created and run well. The accuracy of the pH sensor is 99.99%, and the EC sensor is 99.93%. From the response time characteristics of the pH control system, the rise time is 2.5 minutes, the peak time is 5 minutes, the maximum overshoot is 131.53%, the settling time is 16 minutes, and the steady-state error value is 109.90%. Whereas the characteristic response time of the nutrient solution control system is obtained a rise time of 1.2 s, a peak time of 2 s, a maximum overshoot of 159.55%, a settling time of 14 s, and a steady-state error value amounted to 1.29%.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

Based on the test results, the monitoring and integrated control systems for hydroponic plants have been successfully created and run well. The accuracy of the pH sensor is 99.99%, and the EC sensor is 99.93%. From the response time characteristics of the pH control system, the rise time is 2.5 minutes, the peak time is 5 minutes, the maximum overshoot is 131.53%, the settling time is 16 minutes, and the steady-state error value is 109.90%. Whereas the characteristic response time of the nutrient solution control system is obtained a rise time of 1.2 s, a peak time of 2 s, a maximum overshoot of 159.55%, a settling time of 14 s, and a steady-state error value amounted to 1.29%.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

One way to determine whether the sentiment is positive or negative from an opinion can be solved by sentiment analysis.

In this research, we investigate a machine learning method for classifying movie review sentiment. Then Ensemble Stacking model was chosen as a classification method for this sentiment analysis case. In the classification stage, three algorithms (Na\u00efve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression) are implemented as the base-learners, then the Logistic Regression algorithm is implemented as a meta-classifier to improve the performance of the base-learners in the Ensemble Stacking model. Therefore, testing and comparison between single classification such as the base-learners with the classification method using Ensemble Stacking are the main focus of this research. The results of this research show that the accuracy of this stacking model reaches 89.40%, an increase of 0.71% from the highest accuracy on the base-learners. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

A parametric study is conducted to analyze the influence of variation in some design parameters on the system's performance. The results indicates that both energy and exergy efficiencies enhance as separator pressure, vapor generator terminal temperature difference and condenser temperature decrease, and evaporator temperature increase. Additionally, Ammonia concentration in the Ammonia\u2013water mixture is seen to have opposing effects on efficiencies.

First, the size of PV system was estimated based on the daily electricity consumption and the peak solar hour (PSH) on the site location of the project, so the requirements of the components were obtained. Second, the components selection was performed by surveying the information from the components manufacturers which met with the requirement of the system. Third, economic analysis was performed by considering the capital cost and the final specific energy electric cost. The public street lighting used 80 W lamp and was operated for 12 hours per day. The result showed that the total capital cost for the system was 8,031,400 IDR (551 USD) and the final specific energy cost at 1,960 IDR\/kWh (0.13 USD\/kWh).

In this paper, two procedures: massive data augmentation and validation, are proposed to improve a deep learning-based syllabification, using a combination of bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and conditional random fields (CRF) for a low-resource Indonesian language. The massive data augmentation comprises four methods: transposing nuclei, swapping consonant-graphemes, flipping onsets, and creating acronyms. Meanwhile, the validation is implemented using a phonotactic-based scheme. A preliminary investigation on 50k Indonesian words informs that those augmentation methods significantly enlarge the dataset size by 12.8M valid words based on the phonotactic rules. An examination is then performed using 5-fold cross-validation. It reports that the augmentation methods significantly improve the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model for 50k formal words and 100k named-entities datasets.

Feature extraction of these EEG signals\u00a0was\u00a0then decomposed using DWT function whereas the\u00a0K-NN method is used to classify the EEG signals either in normal or drowsy conditions. The K-NN is done by Euclidean Distance Method. The private dataset consists of 60 signals, divided into 30 signals to normal and drowsy\u00a0each. This research used DWT with eight-level decomposition of Alpha and Beta signals, and 3 wavelet family types (Coiflet, Symlet and Biorthogonal).

            "In face milling process of train wheel, cutter is one of the most important part and this part should be monitored from failure phenomena for improving final products of train wheel during machining process. One of the best ways for face milling tool condition monitoring is by analyzing signal. However, noise usually contaminates the measured signals during measurement using any sensors. This study presents the effect of noise on the Hilbert-Huang transform features for face milling condition monitoring by mean analyzing the synthetic vibration signals.

The aim is to provide the right solution that positively affects Chinese restaurants and form the basis for future research. It aims to establish a method that may invest in a specialty restaurant a culturally rich identity, by implementing the concept of Yin and Yang. It adopted a qualitative case study of the Ta Wan Chinese Restaurant in Indonesia. The respondent was a visitor to Ta Wan restaurant. The results showed that a restaurant designed with the concept of Yin- Yang (Chinese cultural philosophy) with a focus on five aspects, including the organization of space, facilities, atmosphere, colour, and furniture will provide balance to the interior of the restaurant. The concept of this restaurant is proven to solve the problem of comfort and experience of the visitor's room. \u00a9 2021. All Rights Reserved"

The purpose of steganography is that a message can only be seen by the two related parties without being noticed by the other person. In this study, a steganography system was designed using image media to hide a secret message. Image compression is first performed using compressive sensing (CS) so that an image with a smaller resolution is obtained. Stationary wavelet transforms (SWT) are used as the transformation method and singular value decomposition (SVD) is used as the insertion method. To reconstruct or return the compressed message to the original message, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is used. The system performance was tested using salt pepper noise attack and gaussian noise. The test results show that the BER is 0.05765 and the PSNR is 105.666 dB in the steganography system when attacked with salt & pepper noise at a density noise of 0.01. In addition, our system also shows a BER value of 0.0509 at sigma 1 and a PSNR of 104.615 dB when Gaussian noise attacks are applied. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

There are three common models that are used in online taxi dispatch system: (1) first come first served, (2) stable marriage, and (3) agent-based models. Unfortunately, these existing models accommodate passenger's waiting time and\/or driver's pickup cost only. Meanwhile, there are several other important aspects: price, driver's service level, and passenger's behaviour. Based on this problem, this work aims to develop a dispatching model for online taxi system that accommodates these aspects too rather than waiting time and pickup cost only. This model is developed by combining stable marriage and first price sealed bid auction. The stable marriage is used to satisfy both passenger and driver. The first price sealed bid auction is used to offer a competitive price for the passenger that is still accepted by the driver. Based on the simulation result, overall, the proposed model performs the best among the previous models, except in the average pickup distance. In the extreme undersupply condition, the proposed model creates 20 percent higher in the average customer's satisfaction score and equal in the average net distance. In the extreme oversupply condition, the proposed model creates 28 percent higher in the vehicle's satisfaction score. The proposed model creates up to 21 percent lower travel cost. Although the proposed model creates the worst in the average pickup distance, the average pickup time is 3.9 minutes with the assumption that the vehicle's speed is 10 km per hour. \u00a9 2021.

            "Purpose: Village-owned enterprises, in this study called Badan Usaha Milik Desa (BUMDes), are rural communities economic empowerment program developed by the Indonesian Government to encourage the growth of rural entrepreneurship by using the potential of locally owned resources. However, the implementation and effect of the BUMDes program are questionable. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of BUMDes in encouraging rural entrepreneurship and strengthening rural economic development. In addition, this study also explores challenges in implementing the BUMDes program. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study uses a qualitative method with a case study approach. Data were obtained through in-depth interviews using purposive sampling techniques to key people in management at five BUMDes in Garut Regency, West Java, Indonesia, which have successfully implemented the BUMDes program. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that BUMDes are proven to encourage rural entrepreneurship with the dimensions of exploration and empowerment, capacity building and the support and involvement of all stakeholders. BUMDes were established in accordance with government policies based on the village discussion process as the culture of the Indonesian people by involving elements of the village government, associations and the community. However, the challenges in implementing BUMDes are still faced by managers including implementation and regulatory mismatches, lack of qualified human resources and lack of synergy between the village government and BUMDes.

            "Purpose: Village-owned enterprises, in this study called Badan Usaha Milik Desa (BUMDes), are rural communities economic empowerment program developed by the Indonesian Government to encourage the growth of rural entrepreneurship by using the potential of locally owned resources. However, the implementation and effect of the BUMDes program are questionable. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of BUMDes in encouraging rural entrepreneurship and strengthening rural economic development. In addition, this study also explores challenges in implementing the BUMDes program. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study uses a qualitative method with a case study approach. Data were obtained through in-depth interviews using purposive sampling techniques to key people in management at five BUMDes in Garut Regency, West Java, Indonesia, which have successfully implemented the BUMDes program. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that BUMDes are proven to encourage rural entrepreneurship with the dimensions of exploration and empowerment, capacity building and the support and involvement of all stakeholders. BUMDes were established in accordance with government policies based on the village discussion process as the culture of the Indonesian people by involving elements of the village government, associations and the community. However, the challenges in implementing BUMDes are still faced by managers including implementation and regulatory mismatches, lack of qualified human resources and lack of synergy between the village government and BUMDes.

In contrast, the economic conditions deteriorated due to disruption in industry business activities and most people stayed at home and worked from home, which probably reduced the noise pollution. Methods: To assess whether there were differences in noise pollution before and during COVID-19. In this paper, we use various statistical methods following odds ratios, Wilcoxon and Fisher\u2019s tests and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with various comparisons of prior selection.

Photovoltaics have non-linear voltage and current characteristics which influenced by temperature and exposure of solar irradiation so that the maximum power point (MPP) can change at any time. Unfortunately, operating conditions outside the MPP could reduce the efficiency of electrical power transfer from the photovoltaic system to the load. Q-learning (QL) has the potential to provide action decisions of duty cycle signal based on the state of the power gradient percentage range. The Q-learning hybrid method with Type-2 fuzzy logic control is proposed to provide correction of QL control signal by considering the uncertainty direction of power point shifting. The proposed strategy is important particularly to avoid a sudden change in solar irradiation exposure. The simulation results show that the Q-learning hybrid type-2 fuzzy logic control based MPPT response in the photovoltaic control system has tracking efficiency about 97%, rapid rise time of 0.08s, settling time of 0.23s, low overshoot and stable response for handling the change of irradiation and temperature exposure simultaneously. \u00a9 2021.

The simulation results show that the Q-learning hybrid type-2 fuzzy logic control based MPPT response in the photovoltaic control system has tracking efficiency about 97%, rapid rise time of 0.08s, settling time of 0.23s, low overshoot and stable response for handling the change of irradiation and temperature exposure simultaneously. \u00a9 2021.

Hate speech has become one of most common cases found on social media. The spread of hate speech can lead to a riot that might cause conflict, group extermination, and even human casualties. Some of the latest controversies in Indonesia related to hate speech was the hate speech uttered to the government that led to polemic and even demonstration in the country. Along with this, it is important to detect hate speech to avoid conflict to happen. As the spread of hate speech in social media increases, it requires significant human efforts and is costly to detect manually. Therefore, this experiment is built to detect hate speech detection in Indonesian twitter texts using several conventional machine learning and deep learning based, BiGRU, with various features. The machine learning approaches being used are SVM and RFDT, while deep learning based methods used are BiGRU and pre-Trained IndoBERT with BiGRU. Several methods used are Word2vec and fastText. The experiment shows that BiGRU method with IndoBERT and no stop word removal achieves the best performance with 84.77% accuracy. BiGRU has advantages on storing important information from text, thus making a better result than conventional machine learning algorithm. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

            "Dyslexia is considered the most common appearance of a learning disability in the world. Dyslexic students often suffer from emotional issues because of their educational failure experiences. Dyslexia cannot be cured. However, proper and continuous treatment can help students to achieve better results in their studies. The sooner the intervention happens, the better the outcome will be. The research presents the design and development of a mobile application to help dyslexic students to learn how to read. The application is called Learning Dyslexia (Leady). The Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model is used for developing the application. It uses a multisensory approach as the teaching method. Leady aims at young learners so that they can have the intervention from an earlier age. The application design also complies with the appropriate design for dyslexic students, such as in the selection of used fonts and background color. Then, Leady is demonstrated to five dyslexia caretakers (the teachers or parents) from a dyslexia school in Bandung. From the conducted survey, it can be inferred that the method is integrated well since all respondents agree that Leady can help dyslexic students to learn how to read.

This study aims to explore the potential of Islamic boarding schools as places to support and to empower the economy and to increase the participation of students in entrepreneurial activities by applying the Humane Entrepreneurship approach. This study identifies the humane entrepreneurship approach by analyzing the humane cycle and the enterprise cycle in the entrepreneurship activities occurring in a single case study of an Islamic boarding school. Design\/methodology\/approach: This article used a qualitative method with a case study approach through deep exploration and observation. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with the key people in one of the Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia using a purposive sampling technique. Miles and Huberman (1984) technique was used for data analysis by grouping similar text segments into codes and categorizing them for further analysis. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that the Islamic boarding school has implemented humane entrepreneurship through entrepreneurial-oriented activities as the main aspects of the humane cycle and the enterprise cycle. The implementation of humane entrepreneurship aims to achieve entrepreneurial growth, innovation and independence of the Islamic boarding school, as well as the development of the stakeholder's capabilities, knowledge and commitment. In addition, applying the spiritual approach, which is one of the important components of Islamic boarding schools, has proven to be effective in implementing humane entrepreneurship. Research limitations\/implications: This study has several limitations. First, this study only focused on one Islamic boarding school in Indonesia. Second, there is still very little research in the field of humane entrepreneurship, so the concept itself is still considered to be relatively new. Therefore, further direction is needed for future research regarding the exploration and identification of any other factors that might influence humane entrepreneurship. Originality\/value: This study provides new insights on the implementation of humane entrepreneurship in Islamic boarding schools. This research covers the gap where the humane entrepreneurial approach can be applied not only in large organizations, but also in religious educational institutions.

In general, an ASR gives high accuracy for a dialect-specific case, but it obtains a low accuracy for the multi-dialect application, such as for the Indonesian language that has hundreds of dialects. In this research, a system to recognize various dialects in Indonesia is developed. First, an utterance is preprocessed using both normalization and framing. Second, its features are then extracted using the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC), which is one of the feature extraction methods for the best acoustic signals. Finally, a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) is used to learn and classify dialect characteristics. Evaluation of the dataset of five major dialects in Indonesia shows that the greater the Epoch and Bath Size, the greater the accuracy produced by the DRNN. However, accuracy is not directly proportional to the value of both parameters. The Epoch of 30 and Batch Size of 30 are the optimum parameters that yield the highest accuracy of 87.0% for the training set.

The paper maps and characterizes the conditions of open innovation against cleaner production in Indonesian batik small and medium enterprise (SME), particularly in Java and Madura. The mapping process is executed by classifying the batik SME into four quadrants. The diagram is a quadrant in which there are four parts to distinguish each of the ability of batik SMEs in understanding and achieving cleaner production through open innovation. This research will obtain a new method or model that can be applied by organizations to achieve cleaner production through an open innovation. The data is obtained from 182 batik SMEs located in Laweyan, Madura and Lasem (in Java Island, Indonesia). Design\/methodology\/approach: One of the problems in batik SME is the waste management from the dyeing and wax removal process. In the first stages of this research, a number of initial models were elaborated as a reference, then the results of the elaboration became a new research model. The research model that has been produced is then tested using data from respondents. Based on the test results, the model can be stated valid or not. In this study, the model is valid after testing data from 182 respondents, because all outer loading for all indicators is above 0.7. The composite reliability and AVE values of all constructs were above 0.7 and 0.5. Based on the validated research model, the data is statistically processed by using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). By using the SEM method and statistical software SMART PLS 3.0this research can be supported to achieve the research objectives. Findings: Based on data testing and processing, open innovation climate could predict a sustained relationship to open innovation with an accuracy rate of 0.466 and influence rate of 0.427, whereas open innovation could predict a sustained relationship to cleaner production with an accuracy rate of 0.183 and influence rate of 0.324. The relationships between open innovation climate and open innovation; including open innovation toward cleaner production, are statistically significant because all prediction values and accuracy in the model have met the criteria for measurement parameters based on the value of R2, p value and T-statistics to be stated as a significant relationship. Research limitations\/implications: This research provides an overview of the influence and importance of open innovation in creating an environmentally friendly production process in the context of cleaner production. Cleaner production on batik SMEs can be achieved through open innovation, both for inbound open innovation and outbound open innovation. Open innovation comprehensively provides support for batik SMEs in achieving cleaner production. Open innovation can be run well and optimally if it gets support from a conducive climate open innovation. Furthermore, the implementation of cleaner production could be a guideline for the owner to minimize the waste from batik SME production, both for natural and synthetic dyes. Some limitations in these study include the absence of influence from the existing stakeholders on batik SMEs on the implementation process of open innovation; the use of the cross-sectional approach that results in the unavailability of further analysis regarding the dynamics or improvements that occur in attaining cleaner production through open innovation; and finally providing no analysis of the differences in characteristics at each location of batik SMEs. Originality\/value: The implementation of cleaner production model is considered as one of the new methods and references in conjunction with reducing the negative impact of waste toward the environment, particularly in the traditional textile industry which is limited in waste management capability. \u00a9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Besides, the average Sharpe ratio of each stock in the positive low-five and top-five portfolio has been greater than the average Sharpe ratio of the indices. Moreover, the portfolio's return with the positive top-five average ratio Sharpe ratio stocks has outperformed the portfolio's return with positive low-five average Sharpe ratio stocks. We recommend that the Sharpe ratio is computed every six months or three months for BIST 100 and KOMPAS 100 stocks since the return data follow a more normal distribution in shorter periods. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

            "Entropy regularized optimal transport (EOT) distance and its symmetric normalization, known as the Sinkhorn divergence, offer smooth and continuous metrized weak-convergence distance metrics. They have excellent geometric properties and are useful to compare probability distributions in some generative adversarial network (GAN) models. Computing them using the original Sinkhorn matrix scaling algorithm is still expensive. The running time is quadratic at O(n2) in the size n of the training dataset. This work investigates the problem of accelerating the GAN training when Sinkhorn divergence is used as a minimax objective. Let G be a Gaussian map from the ground space onto the positive orthant \u211dr+with r < n. To speed up the divergence computation, we propose the use of c(x, y) = -\u03b5 log \u3008G(x), G(y)\u3009 as the ground cost. This approximation, known as Sinkhorn with positive features, brings down the running time of the Sinkhorn matrix scaling algorithm to O(r n), which is linear in n. To solve the minimax optimization in GAN, we put forward a more efficient simultaneous stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SimSGDA) algorithm in place of the standard sequential gradient techniques. Empirical evidence shows that our model, trained using SimSGDA on the DCGAN neural architecture on tiny-coloured Cats and CelebA datasets, converges to stationary points. These are the local Nash equilibrium points. We carried out numerical experiments to confirm that our model is computationally stable. It generates samples of comparable quality to those produced by prior Sinkhorn and Wasserstein GANs. Further simulations, assessed on the similarity index measures (SSIM), show that our model\u2019s empirical convergence rate is comparable to that of WGAN-GP. \u00a9 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, an adaptive search procedure helps to determine the estimates of the missing data when correlations between attributes are considered in the process. Firefly Algorithm (FA) implements an adaptive search procedure in the imputation of the missing data by determining the estimated value closest to others' value. Therefore, this study proposes a class center-based adaptive approach model for retrieving missing data by considering the attribute correlation in the imputation process (C3-FA). The result showed that the class center-based firefly algorithm (FA) is an efficient technique for obtaining the actual value in handling missing data with the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and root mean squared error (RMSE) close to 1 and 0, respectively. In addition, the proposed method has the ability to maintain the true distribution of data values. This is indicated by the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, which stated that the value of DKSfor most attributes in the dataset is generally closer to 0.

            "Dengue fever is a viral mosquito-borne infection and a major international public health concern. With 2.5 billion people at risk of acquiring the infection around the world, disease severity is influenced by the immunological status of the individual, seronegative or seropositive, prior to natural infection. Caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, infection by one serotype confers life-long immunity to that serotype and a period of temporary cross-immunity (TCI) to other serotypes. The clinical response on exposure to a second serotype is complex with the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) process, a disease augmentation phenomenon when pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection do not neutralize but rather enhance the new infection, used to explain the etiology of severe disease. In this paper, we present a minimalistic mathematical model framework developed to describe qualitatively the dengue immunological response mediated by antibodies. Three models are analyzed and compared: (i) primary dengue infection, (ii) secondary dengue infection with the same (homologous) dengue virus and (iii) secondary dengue infection with a different (heterologous) dengue virus. We explore the features of viral replication, antibody production and infection clearance over time. The model is developed based on body cells and free virus interactions resulting in infected cells activating antibody production. Our mathematical results are qualitatively similar to the ones described in the empiric immunology literature, providing insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe disease.

This study proposes using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm and Markov Random Field (MRF) parameters to segment the TB result image from its background image and count the number of TB yields in the image.

The amount and activity of BAT are inversely correlated with body-mass index and body fat percentage. Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) plays a role in the differentiation and development of BAT, which can be increased by bioactive compounds from several medicinal plants. Moringa oleifera (MO) leaves are rich with vitamin, minerals, and bioactive compounds and have been used for treating obesity-related diseases in the past. The aim of this study was to explore the potency of MO leaf extract (MOLE) to modulate BAT differentiation in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Materials and Methods: Twenty-four, 5-week-old male Deutsche Denken Yoken mice (Mus musculus) were randomly divided into four groups: The normal chow diet group was fed a normal diet, the HFD group was fed a HFD, the HFD+MOLE1, and the HFD+MOLE2 groups were fed HFD and MOLE in a dose of 280 and 560 mg\/kg body weight (BW)\/day, respectively. The experiment was performed for 7 weeks. At the end of the experiment, histological analysis was performed on the interscapular BAT, and blood was drawn for BMP7 protein levels. Results: After 7 weeks, BAT weight in the HFD group was nearly twice in the weight of the HFD+MOLE1 group (125\u00b113.78 mg vs. 75\u00b113.78 mg; p<0.001). There was also a significant increase in BAT cell density in the HFD+MOLE1 group. BMP7 serum protein levels were significantly higher in the HFD+MOLE1 group compared to the HFD group.

            "The mobile communication network has developed rapidly, especially in this era where 5G exists. The 5G and other services are mandatory, supported by a large mobile backhaul capacity. 10-Gigabit-capable symmetric passive optical network (XGS-PON) has the potential to resolve this issue because it can deliver 10 Gbps upstream and downstream simultaneously. This study evaluates the XGS-PON's performance to implement mobile backhaul in a cellular network in Indonesia. This paper proposes a method for ONT testing that is implemented for mobile backhaul. This test method supports the evaluation of device performance in the physical layer and data link layer. The testing results confirmed that XGS-PON ONT supported mobile backhaul with a nominal rate of 9.65296 Gbps, an operating wavelength of 1269.509 nm, launch power 5.63 dBm, sensitivity -26.64 dBm, and overload -5.92 dBm.

            "The mobile communication network has developed rapidly, especially in this era where 5G exists. The 5G and other services are mandatory, supported by a large mobile backhaul capacity. 10-Gigabit-capable symmetric passive optical network (XGS-PON) has the potential to resolve this issue because it can deliver 10 Gbps upstream and downstream simultaneously. This study evaluates the XGS-PON's performance to implement mobile backhaul in a cellular network in Indonesia. This paper proposes a method for ONT testing that is implemented for mobile backhaul. This test method supports the evaluation of device performance in the physical layer and data link layer. The testing results confirmed that XGS-PON ONT supported mobile backhaul with a nominal rate of 9.65296 Gbps, an operating wavelength of 1269.509 nm, launch power 5.63 dBm, sensitivity -26.64 dBm, and overload -5.92 dBm.

When the number of applicants is twice of the number of seats, the proposed model creates 6.6 percent higher in the average student national exam score and 71.4 percent higher in the average school-home distance. The simulation result also shows that the mismatch is solved. \u00a9 2021. All Rights Reserved."

Cancer becomes a very dangerous disease, because it gives no visible signs at an early stage. Signs of cancer will usually only be seen if it is in the third stadium or the last stadium, where the cancer has spread to surrounding organs. Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer is highly needed because treatment choices are decided and the period of survival is heavily affected.

            "In the current time of COVID-19, the demand for access traffic has increased and force service providers to upgrade their infrastructure with higher specification technology. However, with the increase of digital activities from home, the implemented technology must meet residential users' needs. Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) using 10 Gigabit speed technology for broadband access is an innovative solution for high capacity and access requirements. 10-Gigabit-capable symmetric PON (XGS-PON) has become the alternative technology in access networks as it offers symmetric speeds for bidirectional streams. However, the implementation of XGS-PON needs attention from regulators and operators. The research explores the capabilities of XGS-PON ONT used by residential customers with a focus on the physical layer and data link. The study was conducted to provide a standard reference for technical testing parameters and benchmarks before the customer implements the device. The performance evaluation method was carried out by testing on the XGS-PON testbed using quantitative methods. The XGS-PON ONT capability for a nominal line rate is 8.549382 Gbps with FEC. The XGS-PON ONT also works on a wavelength of 1272,363 nm and 4.9 dBm of optical transmit power. The sensitivity value is -28.7 dBm, and the overload value is -2.8 dBm. The results also prove XGS-PON ONT 4096 VLAN ID capacity, VLAN Tagged, VLAN translate, and jumbo frame.

Currently, diagnosis and evaluation are carried out using electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis, which is performed visually by clinicians. Since EEG signals tend to be random and non-stationary, the visual inspection often provides misrepresentation of results. Numerous studies have been proposed computer-based analysis for epileptic EEG classification; however, there is still a gap to improve detection accuracy with a small number of features. Therefore, in this study, we proposed an automatic detection protocol for epileptic EEG classification. The proposed methods are relative wavelet energy and wavelet entropy for feature extraction and combined with the classifier method for automatic detection. In this study, three classes of EEG consisted of pre-ictal, ictal, and interictal were used as test data and also evaluate the proposed method. EEG signals were decomposed using wavelet transform into five conventional sub-bands, including gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta. The relative energy and entropy were then calculated in each of these bands as a feature set. These methods are chosen with consider of low-cost computing. We tested the performance of our feature extraction method using Support Vector Machine (SVM), both linear and non-linear kernels. From the simulation, the highest accuracy was 80-96.7% for ictal vs. pre-ictal, ictal vs. inter-ictal, pre-ictal vs. inter-ictal, and ictal vs. non-ictal.

A Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR) was designed on the ground plane of the FR4 substrate with a rectangular patch antenna on the top plane for antenna size miniaturization, bandwidth improvement, compactness, and isolation enhancement. At first, the presence of the CSRR on the conventional antenna creates additional frequency bands and reduces the frequency of the conventional patch antenna from 24.2 GHz to 5.8 GHz. Even though the CSRR as radiating elements are closer to each other at \u03bb\/4 in the MIMO design, minimum isolation is achieved by limiting the unnecessary surface current flow that exists between the elements of the antenna. Consequently, an orthogonal method of the antenna element is adopted for the four-port MIMO antenna system with high port-to-port measured isolation of less than \u221219 dB, \u221218 dB, and \u201322 dB for 2.4 GHz, 2.9 GHz, and 5.8 GHz frequency bands respectively. Antenna size reduction of 96.87%, 95.41%, and 81.10% and gain of 3.94 dBi, 3.80 dBi, and 4.08 dBi were achieved for the miniaturized multi-band antenna operating at 2.4 GHz, 2.9 GHz, and 5.8 GHz frequency bands, respectively.

Moreover, the proposed integration of CSRR with the antenna for MIMO antenna arrays has the advantage of multi-band operation, size reduction, isolation enhancement, good diversity, and high gain performances.

Caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, infection by one serotype confers life-long immunity to that serotype and a period of temporary cross-immunity (TCI) to other serotypes. The clinical response on exposure to a second serotype is complex with the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) process, a disease augmentation phenomenon when pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection do not neutralize but rather enhance the new infection, used to explain the etiology of severe disease. In this paper, we present a minimalistic mathematical model framework developed to describe qualitatively the dengue immunological response mediated by antibodies. Three models are analyzed and compared: (i) primary dengue infection, (ii) secondary dengue infection with the same (homologous) dengue virus and (iii) secondary dengue infection with a different (heterologous) dengue virus. We explore the features of viral replication, antibody production and infection clearance over time. The model is developed based on body cells and free virus interactions resulting in infected cells activating antibody production. Our mathematical results are qualitatively similar to the ones described in the empiric immunology literature, providing insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe disease. Results presented here are of use for future research directions to evaluate the impact of dengue vaccines. \u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

            "Epilepsy is diagnosed by assessing the brain signal using an electroencephalograph (EEG). The assessment relies on manual visual inspection, which required experience and years of training. A computer-aided diagnose system can help neurologists assess the EEG signal. This study explores the epileptic condition by decomposing EEG signals using three levels of wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). Three orders of Daubechies mother wavelets are used. Since EEG is a non-stationary biological signal, an entropy measurement using the Shannon entropy is used to extract the signals\u2019 information. The next process is combining the features from all levels of the decomposed signals producing 14 number of features. This study reduces the number of features using the wrapper feature subset selection (WFSS) method. The searching algorithm used is the sequential backward (SBS) and forward (SFS) selection method. The multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is used for the classification method. The system achieves the highest accuracy of 91% by using seven number of features obtained from WPD(db2) + WFSS(SBS) + MLPNN. The minimum number of features is obtained using WPD(db16) + WFSS(SFS) + MLPNN, which produces six features. While the use of WFSS(SFS) in db16 produces six features with the highest increase of accuracy by 22%. This indicates that the use of WFSS can obtain an optimal number of features set and can improve the system\u2019s performance. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

The common practice to generate phrase tables in pivot approaches is to use standard symmetrization, i.e., grow-diag-final-and. Although some researchers found that the use of non-standard symmetrization could improve bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores, the use of non-standard symmetrization has not been commonly employed in pivot approaches. In this study, we propose a strategy that uses the non-standard symmetrization of word alignment in phrase table combination.

            "Cancer is a disease that occurs due to the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells causing body tissue damage. This disease is considered as a deadly disease. In 2019, 1700 deaths occur every day due to cancer. Some effective anti-cancer agents are known to cause temporary to chronic toxic effects. There are several compounds that have the potential to become anticancer drugs, one of them is indenopyrazole. Recently, not many QSAR studies have been conducted to exploit the potential of indenopyrazole as anti-cancer agent. The goal of this research is to implement simulated annealing and support vector machine method in the QSAR study to predict the activity of indenopyrazole derivatives as anti-cancer drugs. Simulated annealing is used for feature selection and support vector machine is used for model development. In this research, we used three kernel models for SVM, namely SVM with RBF kernel, SVM with linear kernel, and SVM with the polynomial kernel. From three models that were regressed, SVM with RBF kernel has parameter C=10, gamma=scale and epsilon=0.1 produce R2 score train and test 0.79 and 0.60, respectively. SVM with linear kernel has parameter C=1000, degree=1 and epsilon=0.1 produce R2 score train and test 0.61 and 0.63, respectively. SVM with polynomial kernel has parameter C=1000, degree=2 and epsilon=0.1 produce R2 score train and test 0.72 and 0.50, respectively. Based on the validation results, only model with RBF kernel which parameters satisfy all the criteria. From the result we can conclude that the model with RBF kernel is the best model and acceptable. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

            "Cancer is a disease that occurs due to the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells causing body tissue damage. This disease is considered as a deadly disease. In 2019, 1700 deaths occur every day due to cancer. Some effective anti-cancer agents are known to cause temporary to chronic toxic effects. There are several compounds that have the potential to become anticancer drugs, one of them is indenopyrazole. Recently, not many QSAR studies have been conducted to exploit the potential of indenopyrazole as anti-cancer agent. The goal of this research is to implement simulated annealing and support vector machine method in the QSAR study to predict the activity of indenopyrazole derivatives as anti-cancer drugs. Simulated annealing is used for feature selection and support vector machine is used for model development. In this research, we used three kernel models for SVM, namely SVM with RBF kernel, SVM with linear kernel, and SVM with the polynomial kernel.

            "Recent advances in computer vision with machine learning enabled detection, tracking, and behavior analysis of moving objects in video data. Optical flow is fundamental information for such computations. Therefore, accurate algorithm to correctly calculate it has been desired long time. In this study, it was focused on the problem that silhouette data has edge information but does not have texture information. Since popular algorithms for optical flow calculation do not work well on the problem, a method was proposed in this study.

Through the experiments using 10 videos of animals from the DAVIS 2016 dataset and TV-L1 algorithm for dense optical flow calculation, two values of errors (MEPE and AAE) were evaluated and it was revealed that the proposed method improved the performance of optical flow calculation for various videos.

To this end, the participation of rural communities in the digital business ecosystem is being viewed as a promising approach. However, there are high barriers that hinder rural communities from participating in the digital business ecosystem. The barriers are mainly due to the low digital readiness of the rural communities, the limited government capability, and the limited third-party involvement. With an aim to lower these barriers, our paper proposes the architectural specification of a digital platform based on a service-oriented architecture, where the provisioning of digital business services for rural communities is realized through a collaboration between the government and third-party service providers. The proposed architecture has been instantiated by means of a prototype and validated by a panel of experts from the rural areas of West Java, Indonesia.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

            "Improving the rural economic climate to narrow the rural-urban economic gap is necessary in order to address the problematic urbanization phenomenon in many developing countries. To this end, the participation of rural communities in the digital business ecosystem is being viewed as a promising approach. However, there are high barriers that hinder rural communities from participating in the digital business ecosystem. The barriers are mainly due to the low digital readiness of the rural communities, the limited government capability, and the limited third-party involvement. With an aim to lower these barriers, our paper proposes the architectural specification of a digital platform based on a service-oriented architecture, where the provisioning of digital business services for rural communities is realized through a collaboration between the government and third-party service providers. The proposed architecture has been instantiated by means of a prototype and validated by a panel of experts from the rural areas of West Java, Indonesia.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

The reasons for combining the two methods are that the LBP has proven to be very good at performing feature extraction, especially in describing textures. At the same time, LTP is adept at dealing with uniform motifs such as those on the face area. Subsequently, in this study, we used the NIMH child emotional faces picture set (NIMH-ChEFS), which has five-class expressions: sad, neutral, happy, angry, and afraid.

The amount and activity of BAT are inversely correlated with body-mass index and body fat percentage. Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) plays a role in the differentiation and development of BAT, which can be increased by bioactive compounds from several medicinal plants. Moringa oleifera (MO) leaves are rich with vitamin, minerals, and bioactive compounds and have been used for treating obesity-related diseases in the past. The aim of this study was to explore the potency of MO leaf extract (MOLE) to modulate BAT differentiation in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Materials and Methods: Twenty-four, 5-week-old male Deutsche Denken Yoken mice (Mus musculus) were randomly divided into four groups: The normal chow diet group was fed a normal diet, the HFD group was fed a HFD, the HFD+MOLE1, and the HFD+MOLE2 groups were fed HFD and MOLE in a dose of 280 and 560 mg\/kg body weight (BW)\/day, respectively. The experiment was performed for 7 weeks. At the end of the experiment, histological analysis was performed on the interscapular BAT, and blood was drawn for BMP7 protein levels. Results: After 7 weeks, BAT weight in the HFD group was nearly twice in the weight of the HFD+MOLE1 group (125\u00b113.78 mg vs. 75\u00b113.78 mg; p<0.001).

            "The business continuity of the gig economy is strongly driven by the operator\u2019s ability to manage the maturity of business processes. Moreover, projects in the gig economy are risky due to the lack of monitoring and involvement of actors\u2019 profiles. When business processes become mature as the target, platform-based project results can satisfy actors\u2019 expectations. To reach targeted maturity, operators need to standardize their business processes. This standardization is actualized in a maturity model as a benchmark and guideline tool. It exposes how mature the current business processes are and the required improvements. This research aims to construct a maturity model systematically and comprehensively to encourage operators in the gig economy (as the model user) to improve the products and services delivered. This research has constructed a new maturity model for business processes using the maturity model development phases initiated by de Bruin et al. It explores the gig economy ecosystem in Indonesia. This research initiates the maturity model by collecting 48 factors in the gig economy. It continues by composing 13 determinant candidates as representations of the factors. After an empirical test involving 200 people (consisting of gig worker, client, and operator) and two iterations of mixed-method validation involving 16 experts, this research generates ten determinants classified into three dimensions: Actors, platforms, and transactions. The maturity level of each determinant is measured to indicate its position toward digital business continuity. \u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

            "The business continuity of the gig economy is strongly driven by the operator\u2019s ability to manage the maturity of business processes. Moreover, projects in the gig economy are risky due to the lack of monitoring and involvement of actors\u2019 profiles. When business processes become mature as the target, platform-based project results can satisfy actors\u2019 expectations. To reach targeted maturity, operators need to standardize their business processes. This standardization is actualized in a maturity model as a benchmark and guideline tool. It exposes how mature the current business processes are and the required improvements.

This study presents the effect of noise on the Hilbert-Huang transform features for face milling condition monitoring by mean analyzing the synthetic vibration signals. First, noisy synthetic signals were created, then separates them by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to be intrinsic mode decompositions (IMFs). Second, the Hilbert-Huang spectra were generated and then compared to HHT baseline spectrum. The result showed that the noise disturbed the HHT spectrum.

It is obtained that the required number of gateways for capacity planning is twelve gateways, while for coverage planning, it is only one gateway. Once the calculation results on both capacity and coverage planning are acquired, these results are then simulated using a network simulator software, Forsk Atoll. The assessment of the simulations is done in two categories: the best signal level and the overlapping zones. The simulations results show that RPMA is plausible for smart city deployment in Bandung city with the range for the signal level received is from -70 dBm to -120 dBm with an average received signal level of -59.43 dBm, while the mean value of the overlapping zone is 1.24 server.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

            "With the rapid advancement of wireless communication, sensors, and battery technologies, Swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used for traffic surveillance, and military application. Swarm UAVs, however, need to plan paths through the atmosphere, effectively preventing any collision that can occur when flying a multiple UAV simultaneously. This study proposes to design an anti-collision and a path planning system of swarm UAVs by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The ABC algorithm is an optimization method inspired by the foraging behavior of honeybees. The self-organization trait of honeybees enables them to coordinate themselves to create a global and local optimum. The proposed system, however, uses the ABC algorithm to optimize UAV's velocity, i.e., to reach its destination efficiently in the shortest path while avoiding collision among drones. The establishment of a constraint of a minimum acceptable distance among UAVs enables the algorithm to search for an alternative path in avoiding a collision. The simulation, however, reveals a successful convergence of a swarm UAVs towards a destination with no collision. During the trial with 12 and 20 drones, for instance, all UAVs successfully arrive at their goals with 0 potential collisions. However, during the test with 50 drones, there are 12 possible collisions. Once swarm drones reach their goal position at rest, the cluster will not overlap with other agents, as demonstrated in the visualization. Therefore, the ABC algorithm has satisfied the success criteria for this project and is suitable for swarm drone applications. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.",

            "The construction sector carries out various business activities, ranging from procurement of construction materials, production of building materials and materials, transportation and distribution of materials and materials, as well as the design of building projects or other infrastructure facilities. Of the various activities in the construction sector, each activity can have an impact on the environment. Sustainability supply chain (SSCM) is a concept in the supply chain process that pays attention to three aspects, namely social, economic, and environmental in carrying out supply chain activities. This SSCM concept integrates these three aspects to obtain a sustainable supply chain process. Evaluation of material management activities, especially social and environmental aspects in the supply chain, can be measured through a supply chain performance sustainability approach. This study uses the Sustainable Balanced Scorecard model to map the supply chain strategy and the Supply Chain Operational Reference model to map business processes and determine metrics and ISO 14001 as a clause for the work environment. Based on the integration of the two models, a performance measurement metric is obtained which is used as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) in measuring a sustainable supply chain. Based on the perspective of the BSC model, the research in this research uses three BSC perspectives, namely the financial perspective, the internal business process perspective, and the learning and growth perspective. These three perspectives were chosen based on the company's material management business processes. All company strategies that have been mapped into the previous BSC perspective are remapped with an overview of the relationship between strategies across perspectives. The priority vector shows the weight of each criterion from the matrix. In the financial perspective indicators, weighting is not carried out because the indicators in the financial perspective are not compared to the PCJM questionnaire. The criteria assessment is said to be consistent if the value of the Consistency Ratio is the Consistency Index divided by the Random Index 0.1. Based on the results of the consistency test, it is known that the value of the importance scale is fairly consistent because the entire consistency ratio value is less than 0.1. This research obtains 20 KPIs, which are divided into financial, internal business process and learning growth perspectives.

To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the government has issued various guidelines regarding restrictions on human activity. Jakarta and West Java are two provinces that had a fairly high rate of spread when COVID-19 began to appear. To reduce the rate of spread, local governments in each province have issued a Large Scale Social Restriction (PSBB) policy. After the implementation of this policy, there was a significant decrease in the addition of new cases in the two provinces. Therefore, the government replaced this policy with a new normal policy as well as to address economic problems in society. This new normal policy actually led to the emergence of new cases as a result of failure to follow government-set health protocols.

This paper reports the impact of two policies imposed by the Governor of Jakarta, namely the odd-even and the large-scale social restriction (PSBB) transitional phase-1, against the traffic congestion and air pollution quality in Jakarta during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates the odd-even and PSBB policy impact using paired T-Test. Moreover, this study assesses the relationship between traffic congestion and air pollution using the Pearson correlation. The result shows that the odd-even policy does affect significant only on MH Thamrin Street. Furthermore, the odd-even policy does not significantly affect air pollution reduction in Jakarta. This study also found that there is no meaningful relationship between traffic congestion and air pollution. These results can be used to reference future data-driven policy improvement on traffic congestion and air pollution management in Jakarta and other cities.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

Prediction systems that use machine learning can be applied to improve grow lights control performance, however predictions with limited data can cause the prediction model's performance to be suboptimal. This study aims to optimize the growth light control function in an IoT-based aeroponic system using the sensor fusion concept and random forest classification. To test the effect of the sensor fusion concept in the aeroponic system, a performance comparison of several different random forest models was carried out using different combinations of light intensity, water temperature, and humidity sensor.

            "Grow lights are LED lights specifically for agriculture that can be used for aeroponics because aeroponics is often cultivated in low light conditions, for example in an indoor environment. Prediction systems that use machine learning can be applied to improve grow lights control performance, however predictions with limited data can cause the prediction model's performance to be suboptimal. This study aims to optimize the growth light control function in an IoT-based aeroponic system using the sensor fusion concept and random forest classification. To test the effect of the sensor fusion concept in the aeroponic system, a performance comparison of several different random forest models was carried out using different combinations of light intensity, water temperature, and humidity sensor. The test results show that sensor fusion has a positive effect on the performance of random forest classification in aeroponic systems and with a combination of humidity, light intensity, and water temperature sensors all together, the accuracy obtained by random forest classification is 90.62%. \u00a9 2021 IEEE."

            "In an ultrasound-guided needle insertion, physicians should adjust a certain insertion angle and the position of the transducer to ensure that the initial point and final target are in-plane inside the imaging plane. One of the crucial problems in this interventional procedure is poor and inconsistent needle visibility in B-mode ultrasound. In this research, some potential physical parameters, i.e., ultrasound frequency, the incident angle of the ultrasound beam, needle density, and dimension, are investigated through analytical modeling based on the resonance scattering model to understand their behavior in affecting needle visibility. 25G non-echogenic needle is used as a model object and assumed as stainless-steel hollow cylinder insonified by oblique incident plane wave varied within the frequency of 0\u201310 MHz and incident angle of 0\u00b0\u201345\u00b0. The results suggest that those physical parameters simultaneously affect the occurrence possibility of the resonant modes, which eventually affect the total scattering pressure field S P in a non-linear way. These observed behaviors in the form of the spectrum map of resonance scattering pressure amplitude can be used to adapt a more beneficial combination of those physical parameters to obtain a higher possibility of good needle visibility through practical insertion application and potential echogenic technology or adaptive beamforming. \u00a9 2021.

            "Many ports worldwide continue to expand their capacity by developing a multiterminal system to catch up with the global containerized trade demand. However, this expansion strategy increases the demand for container exchange between terminals and their logistics facilities within a port, known as interterminal transport (ITT). ITT forms a complex transportation network in a large port, which must be managed efficiently given the economic and environmental implications. The use of trucks in ITT operations leads to the interterminal truck routing problem (ITTRP), which has been attracting increasing attention from researchers. One of the objectives of truck routing optimization in ITT is the minimization of empty-truck trips. Selection of the transport order (TO) based on the current truck location is critical in minimizing empty-truck trips. However, ITT entails not only transporting containers between terminals operated 24 h: in cases where containers need to be transported to a logistics facility within operating hours, empty-truck trip cost (ETTC) minimization must also consider the operational times of the transport origin and destination. Otherwise, truck waiting time might be incurred because the truck may arrive before the opening time of the facility. Truck waiting time seems trivial, but it is not, since thousands of containers move between locations within a port every day. So, truck waiting time can be a source of ITT-related costs if it is not managed wisely. Minimization of empty-truck trips and truck waiting time is considered a multiobjective optimization problem. This paper proposes a method of cooperative multiagent deep reinforcement learning (RL) to produce TO truck routes that minimize ETTC and truck waiting time. Two standard algorithms, simulated annealing (SA) and tabu search (TS) were chosen to assess the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method represents a considerable improvement over the other algorithms. \u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",
