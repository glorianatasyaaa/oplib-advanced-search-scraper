            "Temperature is crucial for tea nurseries. Hence, a control and monitoring system is required to maintain the temperature in ideal conditions. However, processing temperature measurement manually causes the temperature inside the tea nursery or sungkup to change. Because when the temperature is measured, the tea nursery cover is opened, making the condition not ideal. In this study, a monitoring and control system is proposed. This system can supervise the tea nursery condition and control the temperature using two-position control method based on temperature. The temperature is measured using the SHT20 sensor. Then, a water or mist sprayer controls the temperature inside the tea nursery. The proposed system is also designed to record and collect the tea nursery condition data. The monitoring and control results show that the system can maintain the temperature in ideal condition at 13\u00b0C-25\u00b0C, corresponding the ideal condition for a tea nursery. Then, the SHT20 sensor has good accuracy, 99.72%. So, it has a minor error with the validated temperature meter. \u00a9 2024 Author(s)."

Meanwhile, there is still no ideal metaheuristic that can solve all problems superiorly, as declared in the no-free-lunch (NFL) theory. This work introduces a novel swarm-based metaheuristic named as migration-crossover algorithm (MCA). In MCA, the swarm intelligence is enriched with the crossover technique and the neighbourhood search with unbalanced local search space. The global finest solution becomes the reference in the first step while the middle between two stochastically chosen solutions becomes the reference in the second step. The neighbourhood search is performed in the third step. The collection of 23 functions become the use case during the evaluation of MCA. In the first evaluation, MCA is compared with five new metaheuristics: total interaction algorithm (TIA), osprey optimization algorithm (OOA), migration algorithm (MA), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and walrus optimization algorithm (WaOA). The result reveals that MCA is finer than TIA, OOA, MA, COA, and WaOA in 20, 19, 17, 20, and 17 functions subsequently. The result of the second evaluation reveals that the global finest solution becomes the dominant contributor in the high dimension functions while the middle between two stochastically chosen solutions becomes the dominant contributor in the fixed dimension functions. \u00a9 (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

            "Named Data Networking (NDN) utilizes caching strategies to manage data caching on network nodes, making it suitable for high-traffic future networks. In-network caching brings desired data packets closer to users topologically, enhancing network performance and satisfying users. However, a critical challenge in NDN network design is determining the Content Store (CS) size allocation for each router. Previous studies overlooked router position, assuming uniform CS sizes. To address this, we proposed a caching strategy with the Social Network Analysis (SNA) algorithm was developed to calculate the influence of an NDN router on the topology. The SNA algorithm includes degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and consolidated centrality. Validated using the ICARUS caching simulator, the study\u2019s results propose an efficient caching strategy for allocating cache storage on all NDN routers. The SNA-based approach outperforms alternatives in cache hit rate, latency, link load, and path stretch, contributing to effective and efficient network planning. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Meanwhile, there is still no ideal metaheuristic that can solve all problems superiorly, as declared in the no-free-lunch (NFL) theory. This work introduces a novel swarm-based metaheuristic named as migration-crossover algorithm (MCA). In MCA, the swarm intelligence is enriched with the crossover technique and the neighbourhood search with unbalanced local search space. The global finest solution becomes the reference in the first step while the middle between two stochastically chosen solutions becomes the reference in the second step. The neighbourhood search is performed in the third step. The collection of 23 functions become the use case during the evaluation of MCA. In the first evaluation, MCA is compared with five new metaheuristics: total interaction algorithm (TIA), osprey optimization algorithm (OOA), migration algorithm (MA), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and walrus optimization algorithm (WaOA). The result reveals that MCA is finer than TIA, OOA, MA, COA, and WaOA in 20, 19, 17, 20, and 17 functions subsequently. The result of the second evaluation reveals that the global finest solution becomes the dominant contributor in the high dimension functions while the middle between two stochastically chosen solutions becomes the dominant contributor in the fixed dimension functions. \u00a9 (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

Quantitative research using multiple linear regression was applied to the data of 30 start-ups incubated at Bandung Techno Park for the 2014\u20132017 period and survival tracking data after the incubation. A qualitative approach to complete the explanatory work was conducted through in-depth interviews with 12 respondents, including start-up graduates from the incubation program, program managers and mentors. Findings: This study confirms that several LS incubation metrics significantly affect start-up sustainability after incubation. In addition, this study also explains several problems in applying the LS discipline that needs attention to increase incubation success. Research limitations\/implications: Research was conducted only at one technology business incubator (TBI) model that focuses on digital start-ups in the emerging ecosystem. Research results can be biased in different situations and ecosystems. Practical implications: The explanation of the relationship of LS-based incubation metrics to the survival of start-ups, as well as the challenges of their implementation, can be a reference for TBI management to consider and prioritize intervention strategies, thereby improving TBI\u2019s business processes and increasing the success rate of incubated start-ups.

The problem is that the end device of the Internet of things (IoT), such as NodeMCU as the device target for placing edge computing programs, has limited resources. This paper proposes a Quantized 8-bit K-Nearest Neighbor (Q8KNN), a novel quantization method that performs model compression on KNN with our case study, the smart lighting control systems, using NodeMCU. Firstly, we have created a novel and accurate smart lighting design that we proposed. The design uses edge computing and KNN models to predict the control data. Then we developed a quantization method to make the KNN model fit into the NodeMCU. Finally, we test the performance of our novel compression model using the Accuracy and Compression Ratio (CR) metrics. The test results show that the number of unique values that change due to quantization does not cause a cardinality problem. Then Q8KNN can provide CR up to 1.6 times. With a smaller model size, Q8KNN can increase the number of training samples in the NodeMCU memory. So, using the same model size, the original KNN gives an accuracy of 94% while Q8KNN can provide up to 98%. \u00a9 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This paper proposes a Quantized 8-bit K-Nearest Neighbor (Q8KNN), a novel quantization method that performs model compression on KNN with our case study, the smart lighting control systems, using NodeMCU. Firstly, we have created a novel and accurate smart lighting design that we proposed. The design uses edge computing and KNN models to predict the control data. Then we developed a quantization method to make the KNN model fit into the NodeMCU. Finally, we test the performance of our novel compression model using the Accuracy and Compression Ratio (CR) metrics. The test results show that the number of unique values that change due to quantization does not cause a cardinality problem. Then Q8KNN can provide CR up to 1.6 times. With a smaller model size, Q8KNN can increase the number of training samples in the NodeMCU memory. So, using the same model size, the original KNN gives an accuracy of 94% while Q8KNN can provide up to 98%. \u00a9 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This paper presents the experimentations on PHP contrived using copper with different inner tube diameters of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm, respectively. The PHP is accused of acetone as a functional liquid with filling proportions varying from 50 to 90% of its volume with an increment of 10%. The effects of filling proportion and tube diameter on the thermal performance of PHP were investigated. The evaporator zone is electrically heated using a mica heater in the range of 20\u201380 W, and the condenser area is kept cool by the water circulation method. The results show that a 2 mm inner tube diameter performs best compared to other tube diameters, with a lower rate of thermal resistance of 0.49 K\/W. Also, the performance of PHP is enhanced at a filling proportion of 60% for all the tube diameters. Further, CFD analysis was carried out for different filling ratios for a 2 mm diameter pipe at a constant heat input of 80 W, and it revealed that test outcomes were in line with CFD results. The deviation between the experimental and numerical studies was 10%. Considering the optimized parameters, i.e., tube diameter and filling ratio, the work was extended by adding SiO2nanoparticles to the base fluid with 1\u20135 % mass concentration. The results showed a lower thermal resistance value of 0.3 W\/K and a higher heat transfer coefficient of 828.64 W\/m2\u00b0K was obtained at 2% mass concentration of SiO2. Also, the proportional rise in heat transfer coefficient at 60 W is 11.46, 17, 14, 4.15, and 1.94% for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% mass concentration of SiO2nanoparticles, respectively.

Furthermore, we found that the dispersion effect was evident from the beginning of the wave formation process.

            "Tea is a widely consumed beverage globally, significantly impacting taste, aroma, and consumer satisfaction. Traditional methods of assessing tea quality rely on subjective sensory evaluation by expert panels, which can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to biases. In recent years, electronic nose (e-nose) technology has emerged as a promising and objective approach to tea quality assessment. This study investigates the application of e-nose technology for the automated and objective assessment of Gambung green tea quality, especially for noninfused (dry) tea aroma. Using noninfused tea has advantages because it does not require a long preparation procedure such as brewing and does not damage the tea sample, so it can be used repeatedly. However, this also has its challenges due to the less strong tea aroma making it more difficult to identify. Machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) were utilized to evaluate their performance in classification and regression tasks. The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm achieved the highest accuracy and provided reliable confusion matrix results. Moreover, the k-NN algorithm outperformed other approaches in predicting organoleptic scores, with the highest R-squared score and the lowest mean squared error values. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of e-nose technology coupled with optimized machine learning algorithms for the noninfused aroma-based identification of Gambung green tea.

Matahari, a retail company, recently shifted its focus towards online marketing. On one of its social media platforms, Matahari consistently presents engaging content. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily imply that Matahari enjoys a high level of social media engagement. This study aims to evaluate how brand equity influences engagement behavior, with engagement goals acting as a mediator, while considering social media context as a moderating factor. The research employed a quantitative approach with a causal orientation. The target population for this study comprises the followers of the Matahi Department Store Instagram account. The sampling method employed was purposive, indicating that the sample was selected based on specific criteria. Data collection was conducted through the online distribution of questionnaires using Google Forms. The collected data was analyzed through the utilization of SMART PLS 3.0 software employing the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method. As per the research results, brand equity is influenced through engagement intention and exhibits a positive and statistically significant impact on both consumption and donation behavior. Additionally, the connection between intention to be involved and behavior in consumption is affected by media richness. \u00a9 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada."

            "The performance of successive interference cancellation (SIC) employing Sequential Power Allocation (SePA) on the NOMA system downlink is discussed in this study. The simulation scenario is based on the variation of the SePA constant value and the number of users ranging from users who are far from the BS to users who are close to the BS. Bit error rate (BER) performance will be investigated using SePA constants and different number of users. Users who are farthest from the BS can directly decode their own signals, while users who are the second farthest to the closest to the BS must perform SIC first. In addition, the performance of the SePA algorithm is compared to Static Power Allocation (SPA) using QPSK modulation and Rayleigh fading channels. The simulation results show that the greater the SePA constant used, the greater the power transmit required to reach BER 10\u22123will be even greater. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

            "Education was one of the sectors most significantly affected by the Covid-19 due to social distancing and home study requirements, which resulted in educational institutions changing the learning process in terms of how classes were delivered. However, whilst there were difficulties from the Covid-19 pandemic, it also resulted in a unique opportunity to implement digital transformation of the education system by bringing about positive change. As a consequence educators and students are required to be able to quickly adapt to changes in the online learning system, and educational institutions must invest and update infrastructure by developing online learning platforms that facilitate the teaching and learning process. Using the lens of Lewin's change model, this study aims to explore the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on educational practices, educator perspectives and key determinants of readiness behavior in universities. This study uses a qualitative method by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who are educators in private universities in Indonesia. This study found that most educators experienced problems during online learning practices, and they realized that these changes in educational practices would continue in the post-Covid era. We also identify two key determinants of behavioural readiness for dealing with change: adaptability and engagement initiative, and innovation in educational practice that helps to understand the digitalization process caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This study has both practical and academic implications by providing recommendations for education policy makers, practitioners and researchers on post-Covid education systems and how to deal with future crises. \u00a9 2023",

The parameters mentioned above are critical for assessing the air quality conditions and concentration of air pollutants. Outdoor air pollution concentration variations before and after the Emergency CARE, which was held in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic on July 3-21, 2021, were studied. An air quality monitoring system based on the IoT generates sensor data that is collected from a government-integrated data portal, and that can be analyzed statistically. There are two main types of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): one-way (or unidirectional) and two-way, which are applied to the collected sensor data and hypotheses calculated using ANOVA. ANOVA one-way was found to be more effective for analyzing air quality condition data. During emergency CARE, the average concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and O3 from the air quality monitoring system show values that have exceeded the standard Air Quality Index (AQI), while the concentrations of CO, NO2, and SO2are still below the applicable AQI values.

The PHP is accused of acetone as a functional liquid with filling proportions varying from 50 to 90% of its volume with an increment of 10%. The effects of filling proportion and tube diameter on the thermal performance of PHP were investigated. The evaporator zone is electrically heated using a mica heater in the range of 20\u201380 W, and the condenser area is kept cool by the water circulation method. The results show that a 2 mm inner tube diameter performs best compared to other tube diameters, with a lower rate of thermal resistance of 0.49 K\/W. Also, the performance of PHP is enhanced at a filling proportion of 60% for all the tube diameters. Further, CFD analysis was carried out for different filling ratios for a 2 mm diameter pipe at a constant heat input of 80 W, and it revealed that test outcomes were in line with CFD results. The deviation between the experimental and numerical studies was 10%. Considering the optimized parameters, i.e., tube diameter and filling ratio, the work was extended by adding SiO2nanoparticles to the base fluid with 1\u20135 % mass concentration. The results showed a lower thermal resistance value of 0.3 W\/K and a higher heat transfer coefficient of 828.64 W\/m2\u00b0K was obtained at 2% mass concentration of SiO2.

Wave forecasting is very necessary to support daily marine activities such as marine transportation scheduling and daily operation offshore or in the harbor, so that these activities can be carried out with careful planning and can minimize the risk of accidents. Significant wave height (SWH) and peak wave period (Tp) predictions are essential to wave forecasting. In this research, we perform a time series wave forecasting for SWH and Tp using a relatively recent deep learning model, i.e., Transformer. As a case study, we choose a location in the southern part of Java island, Indonesia, i.e., on the Cilacap coast. We also compare the Transformer results with the well-known LSTM model. Transformer is used because it has an architecture based on encoder and decoder methods which allows this model to learn data better and also train the model faster in terms of performance. Meanwhile, LSTM is used because it's ability to remember long backward historical data. The result shows that the Transformer model performs better in terms of correlation coefficient and root mean squared error than the LSTM model for Hs. At the same time, LSTM came as a better model for Tp than the Transformer.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

One example of another option is the use of biomass. An example of using biomass is the gasification process. This process was carried out in a device called a gasification stove, namely a gasifier. A gasifier has been developed to produce an optimal combustion system. The constraints in this development are costs for manufacture and the potential for failure. Therefore, simulations using Ansys Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software student versions were carried out to reduce the costs for manufacture and the potential for failure of the gasifier. The simulation contains dimensional variations and the number of air inlets of gasifier of downdraft gasifier, updraft gasifier, and entrained flow gasifier. Further, the influence of the dimensions and quantity of inlet that affect each design's efficiency and the temperature was examined. The simulation results show that the best dimensions for the downdraft gasifier, updraft gasifier, and entrained flow gasifier are height and diameter of 50cm; 14.5cm (A1), 144cm; 70cm (C1), and 900cm; 300cm (B3), respectively. The best number of air inlets of A1, C1, and B3 gasifiers is 6, 1, and 6, respectively. Thus, the efficiency of each gasifier A1, C1, and B3 are 11.393%, 9.354%, and 50.885%, respectively. Furthermore, the A1, C1, and B3 gasifiers temperatures were 1055.25 K, 1383.44 K, and 3580.15 K, respectively. Therefore, this study suggested that the gasifier development could be optimized using simulation to reduce manufacturing costs and failures.  \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Well-known risk factors include hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, along with exposure to aflatoxins, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Genomic variants play a crucial role in mediating the associations between these risk factors and liver cancer. However, the specific variants involved in this process remain under-explored. This study utilized a bioinformatics approach to identify genetic variants associated with liver cancer from various continents. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with liver cancer were retrieved from the genome-wide association studies catalog. Prioritization was then performed using functional annotation with HaploReg v4.1 and the Ensembl database. The prevalence and allele frequencies of each variant were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Two variants, rs2294915 and rs2896019, encoded by the PNPLA3 gene, were found to be highly expressed in the liver tissue, as well as in the skin, cell-cultured fibroblasts, and adipose-subcutaneous tissue, all of which contribute to the risk of liver cancer. We further found that these two SNPs (rs2294915 and rs2896019) were positively correlated with the prevalence rate. Positive associations with the prevalence rate were more frequent in East Asian and African populations. We highlight the utility of this population-specific PNPLA3 genetic variant for genetic association studies and for the early prognosis and treatment of liver cancer. This study highlights the potential of integrating genomic databases with bioinformatic analysis to identify genetic variations involved in the pathogenesis of liver cancer. The genetic variants investigated in this study are likely to predispose to liver cancer and could affect its progression and aggressiveness.

The samples used were 71 people from the 200 members of DPS across Indonesia. The sampling method used was based on R2value and significance level with an 80% statistical strength. Data analysis was carried out using smartPLS software to test the relationship of change management, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and leadership style on employee performance. Findings: The utilization of SEM in Smart PLS for change management with the ADKAR method had a negative value of 6.2% in affecting employee performance and 4.6% in affecting job satisfaction.

            "The displacement on the bridge structure is an essential parameter in identifying the bridge structure's health. The noncontact measurement method is preferable in practice, and the radar system is potentially employed for developing displacement measurement technology. Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar has a feature for detecting the target location. However, estimating the small displacement in the bridge structure requires extensive bandwidth to reach the proper resolution. The problem of obtaining the required resolution, and adopting the decrease in accuracy due to several possible radar placements during measurement are addressed in this article. The concept of bridge displacement measurement using a modified FMCW radar system is proposed. Phase information extraction is employed to reach the displacement detection resolution, and the radar elevation detection based on an inclinometer is equipped in the proposed radar system. The simulation and laboratory experiments were conducted by implementing the proposed radar system for detecting the displacement in the bridge model. The experiment results confirm that the proposed FMCW radar was able to estimate the bridge displacement and overcome the decreasing accuracy due to the radar elevation. The multipoint detection technique is also developed in the proposed radar and is capable to capture the displacement profile over the bridge span. The proposed FMCW system is then recommended as a radar system in developing a noncontact method for bridge displacement measurement and monitoring.  \u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.",

            "The displacement on the bridge structure is an essential parameter in identifying the bridge structure's health. The noncontact measurement method is preferable in practice, and the radar system is potentially employed for developing displacement measurement technology. Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar has a feature for detecting the target location. However, estimating the small displacement in the bridge structure requires extensive bandwidth to reach the proper resolution. The problem of obtaining the required resolution, and adopting the decrease in accuracy due to several possible radar placements during measurement are addressed in this article. The concept of bridge displacement measurement using a modified FMCW radar system is proposed. Phase information extraction is employed to reach the displacement detection resolution, and the radar elevation detection based on an inclinometer is equipped in the proposed radar system. The simulation and laboratory experiments were conducted by implementing the proposed radar system for detecting the displacement in the bridge model. The experiment results confirm that the proposed FMCW radar was able to estimate the bridge displacement and overcome the decreasing accuracy due to the radar elevation. The multipoint detection technique is also developed in the proposed radar and is capable to capture the displacement profile over the bridge span. The proposed FMCW system is then recommended as a radar system in developing a noncontact method for bridge displacement measurement and monitoring.  \u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE."

Tourists who don't know Yogyakarta, of course, need the services of a travel agent to plan a tourist visit. For backpackers, the services of this travel agent are very expensive. It would be better if there was an application that could recommend tourist routes based on tourist needs. However, not many applications have been developed that are able to accommodate this. Therefore, in this study, we propose a recommender system that is able to generate travel itineraries for tourist visits in a few days.

Searching for optimal tourist objects involves an algorithm capable of solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm that we use in this study is the Simulated Annealing Algorithm. In addition, to accommodate the needs of our users we use the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). To test the performance of our proposed system, we use the Firefly Algorithm as the base model.

Prison institutions play an active role in building character and improving prisoners' skills by providing various empowerment programs to increase opportunities for their economic potential. However, these programs are considered not optimal in increasing the entrepreneurial intentions of prisoners. This study aims to identify the effects of prison entrepreneurship programs, entrepreneurial resilience and self-efficacy as drivers in increasing prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions. This study also examines the effect of these variables focusing on prisoners with neither entrepreneurial experience nor entrepreneurial training. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study deployed a quantitative method by distributing a questionnaire to prisoners involved in talent and skill development activities (called BIMKER, an abbreviation in Indonesian, which means Work Guidance), a compulsory program provided by prison institutions. A total of 204 prisoners, including 70 with no entrepreneurial experience, completed the research questionnaire in one of the prison institutions in Indonesia. Partial least sequential-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used as the analytical technique. Findings: The study findings show that the prison entrepreneurship program has not been able to influence prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions directly. However, the prison entrepreneurship program has a positive and significant effect on increasing prisoners' self-efficacy and entrepreneurial resilience that ultimately encourages the emergence of entrepreneurial intentions. Entrepreneurial resilience was found not to affect entrepreneurial intentions for prisoners with no entrepreneurial experience and who have never attended entrepreneurship training. Originality\/value: This study identifies the drivers of prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions, including prison entrepreneurship programs, self-efficacy and entrepreneurial resilience. These can be used as references to build understanding at the theoretical level and can be adopted practically. This study expands the social cognitive theory (SCT) and entrepreneurial intention models (EIMs) by adding new insights into the context of prison entrepreneurship that underline the potential of prisoners engaging in entrepreneurship, once released, to expand opportunities, learning and employment.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, recordings of spontaneous electric fields generated by neuronal activity in the brain, played a crucial role in this research, enabling us to diagnose neurological conditions and explore applications in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology. Nevertheless, raw EEG signals were prone to noise contamination, such as electromyography artifacts from muscle movements and electrooculography artifacts from eye blinking, which could adversely impact signal analysis. To overcome this challenge, we employed pre-processing techniques involving fourth-order Butterworth filters and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to reject and reduce noise from the EEG data. The EEG signals were recorded while participants performed a go\/no-go association task (GNAT), allowing us to gain insights into the cognitive responses and neural activity patterns related to drug exposure in the teenage population. The combination of EEG signal recording with the GNAT task provided a powerful and informative approach to understanding the cognitive implications of drug exposure in teenagers. In conclusion, obtaining a clean EEG signal is essential for accurately exploring the correlation between responses in the GNAT and brain waves, thereby enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of the cognitive effects of drug exposure in teenagers and its potential impact on neural activity patterns.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Our study was conducted in one of the leading telecommunication companies in Indonesia. The company faces challenges in improving services so that business performance is more effective and efficient than before. Previously, the company used a Wide Area Network (WAN) connection network, however, this network is no longer sufficient because internet traffic has now changed. Therefore, the company adopts SD-WAN which replaces Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) with multi-broadband internet with high bandwidth. It is encrypted with Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) Virtual Private Network (VPN) standards and simplifies branch management with one dashboard that includes many branches. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the adoption of SD-WAN architecture within the company. Evaluation is carried out on business processes that have implemented the SD-WAN network architecture based on The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). The evaluation results will be described in this study, and it is expected that the evaluation results can provide recommendations for improving the quality of SD-WAN adoption so that the company can align technology with business needs.

The company faces challenges in improving services so that business performance is more effective and efficient than before. Previously, the company used a Wide Area Network (WAN) connection network, however, this network is no longer sufficient because internet traffic has now changed. Therefore, the company adopts SD-WAN which replaces Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) with multi-broadband internet with high bandwidth. It is encrypted with Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) Virtual Private Network (VPN) standards and simplifies branch management with one dashboard that includes many branches. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the adoption of SD-WAN architecture within the company. Evaluation is carried out on business processes that have implemented the SD-WAN network architecture based on The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). The evaluation results will be described in this study, and it is expected that the evaluation results can provide recommendations for improving the quality of SD-WAN adoption so that the company can align technology with business needs. The results of this study can also be a consideration for future researchers or practitioners who will implement SD-WAN in an organization. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "The effect of amplitude or phase weighting of excited signal on a feeding network of antenna array will impact on the array radiation characteristics. This paper discusses performance evaluation on radiation characteristics of a Kaiser-based linear antenna array with small even variations of elements number (N), namely 1 \u00d7 4, 1\u00d7 6, and 1 \u00d7 8. The use of Kaiser function in weighting method will give significant sidelobe level (SLL) suppression and offer a flexibility by changing the value of \u03b2 parameters. Moreover, the increase of N also affects the diminishment of width of main lobe (WML) value and provides almost constant front to back ratio (FBR) value. In 1\u00d74 Kaiser-based linear antenna array, the radiation characteristics show the non-appearance of sidelobe, so the SLL suppression value is undetermined, whereas the WML and FBR values are 30\u00b0 and 13.32 dB, respectively. The performance of a 1 \u00d7 6 Kaiser-based linear antenna array has the SLL suppression from -34.35 dB up to -33.73 dB, WML of 25\u00b0, and FBR of 13.36 dB. Meanwhile, the radiation characteristics of 1\u00d78 Kaiser-based linear antenna array provide the SLL suppression from -34.26 dB up to -33.87 dB, WML of 17\u00b0, and FBR of 13.36 dB. Furthermore, the gain achievements show the enhancement for the bigger number of N, namely 8.43 dB for 1 \u00d7 4, 9.13 dB for 1 \u00d7 6, and 11.07 dB for 1\u00d78.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

The increase in channel capacity in PD-NOMA multiple access means that the maximum power used by each user in each narrow band achieves increased power efficiency. Therefore, this research focuses on facilitating the increase in channel capacity by designing an antenna that produces a radiation pattern with many sharp main lobes and high gain. The multi-beam radiation pattern is obtained by using edge weighting. Therefore the antenna is designed with odd and even numbers represented by 1x5 and 1x6 antennas on the microstrip patch rectangular antenna at a frequency of 2.6 GHz. The effect of parasitic and non-parasite effects on the radiation pattern of a planar antenna with edge modeling is manageable in the main lobe, only in the side level lobe, which is not too significant.

            "The use of electrical energy continues to increase from time to time, in line with the promotion of green energy. Prediction of the use of electricity load is crucial for increasing electricity production efficiency, especially for electricity companies. One way of approaching electrical load prediction is with a machine learning model. This study modeled short-term time series forecasting of electricity load using the CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model with an attention mechanism to calculate short-term predictions, namely 1, 3, and 7 days ahead. The study aims to see the effects of additional attention mechanisms in the hybrid model CNN-BiLTSM with the resulting accuracy that the model gets. Furthermore, we also compare the CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model with attention to the BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM models. As a case study, this study used data on the electricity load in Bali, Indonesia. We also compare the experimental results to show that the CNN-BiLSTM with Attention model produces the best accuracy, with a root mean square error of 13.676 and a correlation coefficient 0.993 compared to the other two. These experiments have shown that improving predictions of electricity usage can be achieved by combining the original BiLSTM model with both a CNN layer and an attention mechanism. While the tests conducted primarily focused on short-term forecasting, the CNN-BiLSTM model with an attention mechanism shows potential for further exploration in the realm of intermediate and long-term forecasting.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

            "The use of electrical energy continues to increase from time to time, in line with the promotion of green energy. Prediction of the use of electricity load is crucial for increasing electricity production efficiency, especially for electricity companies. One way of approaching electrical load prediction is with a machine learning model. This study modeled short-term time series forecasting of electricity load using the CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model with an attention mechanism to calculate short-term predictions, namely 1, 3, and 7 days ahead. The study aims to see the effects of additional attention mechanisms in the hybrid model CNN-BiLTSM with the resulting accuracy that the model gets. Furthermore, we also compare the CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model with attention to the BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM models. As a case study, this study used data on the electricity load in Bali, Indonesia. We also compare the experimental results to show that the CNN-BiLSTM with Attention model produces the best accuracy, with a root mean square error of 13.676 and a correlation coefficient 0.993 compared to the other two. These experiments have shown that improving predictions of electricity usage can be achieved by combining the original BiLSTM model with both a CNN layer and an attention mechanism. While the tests conducted primarily focused on short-term forecasting, the CNN-BiLSTM model with an attention mechanism shows potential for further exploration in the realm of intermediate and long-term forecasting.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

The test results show that with a pixelized image, the accuracy of the test data using our CNN model is 0.75. Some of our perturbed images are correctly detected as persons. Furthermore, this system is refined with a user interface (UI) for consent and a security system provided by Raspberry Pi, which runs the image perturbation. Our contribution is a novel camera-based smart lighting architecture that complies with GDPR requirements.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "This paper introduces a novel swarm-based metaheuristic called swarm magnetic optimizer (SMO). SMO imitates the behaviour of two magnets close to each other: pushing toward or pulling away from each other. This pushpull mechanism is then adopted to become a novel search in SMO. SMO is set up as a swarm of magnets that move autonomously. In the early iteration, the pull strategy is dominant. Meanwhile, it declines during the iteration and is replaced by a push strategy. The determination between these two strategies is calculated stochastically. SMO consists of three sequential phases in every iteration where the corresponding magnet and its reference run a push or pull search in each phase. The reference used in each phase is the global best magnet, a randomly selected magnet, and a randomly generated magnet. This paper evaluates SMO through simulation to find the optimal solution for 23 functions. The performance of SMO is compared with five latest metaheuristics: mixed leader-based optimizer (MLBO), guided pelican algorithm (GPA), zebra optimization algorithm (ZOA), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and clouded leopard optimizer (CLO). The result shows that SMO is better than MLBO, GPA, ZOA, COA, and CLO in consecutively 22, 15, 11, 13, and 14 functions. The superiority of SMO, especially, is in solving high dimension functions.

Our research aim is to utilize the area under curve (AUC) maximization for flood attack detection on MQTT with imbalanced datasets. We leverage datasets from existing papers for flood attacks and legitimate network data. Then we utilize the AUC maximization methodology as follows: we perform parameter tuning of three machine learning methods: gradient boosting, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Then we measure the performance of each model with the receiver operating curve (ROC) and AUC. We repeated these steps by performing parameter tuning and feature selection until the optimum AUC was found. Our test results show that the f1-score test can be used in the majority class but gives poor results in the minority class. At the same time, AUC shows that gradient boosting is the optimum detection method compared to naive Bayes and KNN, with AUCs of 0.96, 0.86, and 0.77, respectively.

            "In plantation areas, soil conditions affect the crop's quality. One of the crucial elements in the soil for plant survival is soil water content (SWC). Radar system has advantages that can be implemented for measuring SWC in plantation areas. A radar system operates by utilizing electromagnetic waves to obtain the dielectric characteristics of the soil. However, the presence of tea plants has become an obstacle to the radar wave propagation toward the soil layer.

The binder was used to bind the mixture of the two carbons, which were stuck together into the current collector. The CMC is a popular binder for supercapacitors due to its high wettability, environmentally friendly, and cheap. However, the CMC is easy to swelling in aqueous electrolytes, which reduces the mechanical properties of the electrode. Here, we propose alternative curing agents to improve the mechanical properties of CMC. The curing agents are epoxy resin, SBR-2 (styrene-butadiene rubber copolymer), and acrylic. For manufacturing the electrodes, the activated carbon, carbon black, CMC, and the curing agents were mixed together and were put on the nickel foam. The produced electrodes were then characterized using the adhesive test, contact angle test, and cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the epoxy resin is the finest curing agent of the CMC-based binder, with adhesive strength of 99.19%. However, the specific capacitance of the electrode with CMC-epoxy resin was lower (37.3 F\/g) than the pristine CMC (54.69 F\/g). This is caused by the highest contact angle of 33.0\u00b10.13\u00b0which indicated the low wettability. The result of this study implies that the CMC-epoxy resin can improve the mechanical properties of the pristine CMC binder and can be an alternative binder for aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors.  \u00a9 2023 Author(s)."

However, rainwater that has been held for more than two months will be hazy and mossy in appearance. Rainwater must, therefore, first be treated to make it clearer. Rainwater was treated using clinoptilolite-type zeolite. We used two sizes of zeolite particles: large (0.02 cm) and small (0.002 cm). The zeolite was activated in an oven at 225 \u00b0C for 3 hours. After 50 hours of immersion, it was found that large-sized zeolite could lower the turbidity of rainwater by up to 86.2% without increasing the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) value. Small-sized zeolite might reduce the turbidity of rainwater by 8% for the same immersion time. These findings show that larger zeolites are more efficient at reducing rainwater turbidity. Large-sized zeolite does not require any further processing to be made smaller before use because it is readily available on the market. Furthermore, it showed that the zeolite-based rainwater treatment process employs the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. \u00a9 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.",

To complement that, rather than using the classic geometrical approach (such as multilateration), it uses a more data-driven approach, i.e., the location fingerprinting technique. The fingerprint of a location, in this case, is a set of Wi-Fi ToFs between the target device and an access point (AP). Therefore, the number of APs in the area dictates the set size. The location fingerprinting technique requires a collection of fingerprints of various locations in the area to build a reference database or map. This database or map contains the information used to carry out the main task of the location fingerprinting technique, namely, estimating the position of a device based on its location fingerprint. For that task, we propose using a fully connected deep neural network (FCDNN) model to act as a positioning engine.

            "Introduction: Predicting ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de Pointes (TdP) caused by drug-induced cardiotoxicity is essential in drug development. Several studies used single biomarkers such as qNet and Repolarization Abnormality (RA) in a single cardiac cell model to evaluate TdP risk. However, a single biomarker may not encompass the full range of factors contributing to TdP risk, leading to divergent TdP risk prediction outcomes, mainly when evaluated using unseen data. We addressed this issue by utilizing multi-in silico features from a population of human ventricular cell models that could capture a representation of the underlying mechanisms contributing to TdP risk to provide a more reliable assessment of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Method: We generated a virtual population of human ventricular cell models using a modified O\u2019Hara-Rudy model, allowing inter-individual variation. (Formula presented.) and Hill coefficients from 67 drugs were used as input to simulate drug effects on cardiac cells. Fourteen features ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), qNet, qInward) could be generated from the simulation and used as input to several machine learning models, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Optimization of the machine learning model was performed using a grid search to select the best parameter of the proposed model. We applied five-fold cross-validation while training the model with 42 drugs and evaluated the model\u2019s performance with test data from 25 drugs. Result: The proposed ANN model showed the highest performance in predicting the TdP risk of drugs by providing an accuracy of 0.923 (0.908\u20130.937), sensitivity of 0.926 (0.909\u20130.942), specificity of 0.921 (0.906\u20130.935), and AUC score of 0.964 (0.954\u20130.975).

            "Introduction: Predicting ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de Pointes (TdP) caused by drug-induced cardiotoxicity is essential in drug development. Several studies used single biomarkers such as qNet and Repolarization Abnormality (RA) in a single cardiac cell model to evaluate TdP risk. However, a single biomarker may not encompass the full range of factors contributing to TdP risk, leading to divergent TdP risk prediction outcomes, mainly when evaluated using unseen data. We addressed this issue by utilizing multi-in silico features from a population of human ventricular cell models that could capture a representation of the underlying mechanisms contributing to TdP risk to provide a more reliable assessment of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Method: We generated a virtual population of human ventricular cell models using a modified O\u2019Hara-Rudy model, allowing inter-individual variation. (Formula presented.) and Hill coefficients from 67 drugs were used as input to simulate drug effects on cardiac cells. Fourteen features ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), qNet, qInward) could be generated from the simulation and used as input to several machine learning models, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Optimization of the machine learning model was performed using a grid search to select the best parameter of the proposed model. We applied five-fold cross-validation while training the model with 42 drugs and evaluated the model\u2019s performance with test data from 25 drugs. Result: The proposed ANN model showed the highest performance in predicting the TdP risk of drugs by providing an accuracy of 0.923 (0.908\u20130.937), sensitivity of 0.926 (0.909\u20130.942), specificity of 0.921 (0.906\u20130.935), and AUC score of 0.964 (0.954\u20130.975). Discussion and conclusion: According to the performance results, combining the electrophysiological model including inter-individual variation and optimization of machine learning showed good generalization ability when evaluated using the unseen dataset and produced a reliable drug-induced TdP risk prediction system.

            "Nowadays, the imbalanced data problem is still a crucial issue in classifying, especially in the medical data domain. For this reason, in this study, we propose a hybrid sampling method that combines adaptive synthetic sampling as an oversampling method and Tomek links as an undersampling method (ADASYN-Tomek) to improve the performance of the classification model. ADASYN has the advantage of synthesizing according to the hard-to-learn conditions of minor class samples. On the other hand, the Tomek links method can overcome class overlapping problems and remove noise. We conducted experiments on the pima indians diabetes data set obtained from the KEEL repository. The experimental results show that ADASYN-Tomek is better than the ADASYN or Tomek single method with a balanced accuracy score and F1score are 0.797 and 0.822, respectively. Furthermore, to improve the performance of the classification model, we performed tuning of the n-neighbors parameter in the oversampling process. We found an increase in the balanced accuracy score and F1-score to 0.835 and 0.856, respectively. The result indicates that the hybrid sampling method has the potential to be further developed to improve the classification model performance in various domain data sets.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

Prison institutions play an active role in building character and improving prisoners' skills by providing various empowerment programs to increase opportunities for their economic potential. However, these programs are considered not optimal in increasing the entrepreneurial intentions of prisoners. This study aims to identify the effects of prison entrepreneurship programs, entrepreneurial resilience and self-efficacy as drivers in increasing prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions. This study also examines the effect of these variables focusing on prisoners with neither entrepreneurial experience nor entrepreneurial training. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study deployed a quantitative method by distributing a questionnaire to prisoners involved in talent and skill development activities (called BIMKER, an abbreviation in Indonesian, which means Work Guidance), a compulsory program provided by prison institutions. A total of 204 prisoners, including 70 with no entrepreneurial experience, completed the research questionnaire in one of the prison institutions in Indonesia. Partial least sequential-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used as the analytical technique. Findings: The study findings show that the prison entrepreneurship program has not been able to influence prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions directly. However, the prison entrepreneurship program has a positive and significant effect on increasing prisoners' self-efficacy and entrepreneurial resilience that ultimately encourages the emergence of entrepreneurial intentions. Entrepreneurial resilience was found not to affect entrepreneurial intentions for prisoners with no entrepreneurial experience and who have never attended entrepreneurship training. Originality\/value: This study identifies the drivers of prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions, including prison entrepreneurship programs, self-efficacy and entrepreneurial resilience. These can be used as references to build understanding at the theoretical level and can be adopted practically. This study expands the social cognitive theory (SCT) and entrepreneurial intention models (EIMs) by adding new insights into the context of prison entrepreneurship that underline the potential of prisoners engaging in entrepreneurship, once released, to expand opportunities, learning and employment.

The research employs the PM4Py open-source toolkit, including PM4Py-GPU for computationally intensive tasks. Through fitness alignments between event logs and process models, it is found that approximately 47.128 percent of traces match the process model, exhibiting a good level of conformity with an average fitness of 0.8888.

A safer peptide-based ACE1 inhibitor derived from salmon skin collagen, that is considered as the by-product of the fish processing industry have been investigated in this study. The inhibitory activity against ACE1 was examined using in vitro and in silico methods. In vitro analysis includes the extraction of acid-soluble collagen, characterization using FTIR, Raman, UV\u2013Vis, XRD, cytotoxicity assay,\u00a0and determination of inhibition against ACE1. In silico method visualizes binding affinity, molecular interaction, and inhibition type of intact collagen and active peptides derived from collagen against\u00a0ACE1\u00a0using molecular docking. The results of FTIR spectra detected amide functional groups (A, B, I, II, III) and imine proline\/hydroxyproline, while the results of Raman displayed peak absorption of amide I, amide III, proline\/hydroxyproline ring, phenylalanine, and protein backbone. Furthermore, UV\u2013Vis spectra showed typical collagen absorption at 230\u00a0nm and based on XRD data, the chain types in the samples were \u03b1-helix. ACE1 inhibition activity was obtained in a concentration-dependent manner where the highest was 82.83% and 85.84% at concentrations of 1000, and 2000\u00a0\u00b5g\/mL, respectively, and showed very low cytotoxicity at the concentration less than 1000\u00a0\u00b5g\/mL. In silico study showed an interaction between ACE1 and collagen outside the active site with the affinity of \u2212\u00a0213.89\u00a0kcal\/mol.

However, some companies still do those two things slowly or manually and make their technology strategy not work well. It makes companies not agile towards changes in competition in their market business. This study investigates the slow provision of infrastructure and the manual deployment of applications at one company in the electric vehicle sector that is focused on building a stable and reliable digital ecosystem for electric motorcycles. The goal is to explore how Cloud-Native Architecture (CNA) and DevOps culture can accelerate those two processes through automation. The research method used is qualitative descriptive, employing the DevOps model within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This study proposes the implementation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Version Control Systems (VCS), and Continuous Integration\/Continuous Deployment (CI\/CD). The research findings demonstrate that the use of CNA and DevOps culture can reduce the time required for infrastructure provisioning and application deployment, decrease human errors, improve documentation consistency, and enhance overall system reliability within the company environment. The results of this study can increase the knowledge base about the synergy between CNA and DevOps.

This approach is made so that the information about ocean wave conditions can be obtained in a high resolution and more accurate. Accurate wave forecasting information can prevent accidents when carrying out marine activities highly dependent on wave conditions, such as shipping, ocean engineering, and other maritime operations. Traditional local approach for local wave forecasting is usually obtained by performing simulation from global grid wave information into a high-resolution local grid using numerical simulation. This approach demands high computational cost. We propose a machine-learning approach for downscaling modeling that will use global wave height data and turn it into high-resolution local wave height data using the Transformer model.

In this study case, XYZ assigned to execute the Pertamina SPBU Digitization project covering construction work, civil work, integration, and maintenance. The work was carried out at 89 gas station sites that were included in the West Bandung Witel work area coverage. In the project work process, there were many mistakes during civil work and integration carried out by a third-party vendor. After analyzing the cause of the error, it is known at the planning stage of PT. Telkom Akses does not do a quality management plan that produces quality metrics. Lack of quality metrics in this project causes third-party vendors not to have project work guidelines that are specified with standard specifications.

In this case, the observation of an ophthalmologist is needed to check it. However, an expert doctor's observation is subjective, so it takes a long time and is inconsistent. So a computer-Aided diagnostic (CAD) system was built to detect glaucoma early on, fundus image analysis automation, time efficiency through optical disc and cup segmentation, and Cup to Disc Ratio (CDR) calculations. Several previous studies have proposed using models based on Vision Transformers (ViT), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and a combination of the two. However, the ViT model has problems: The number of model computations increases when the image size also increases, and the CNN-based encoder-decoder model has a large size and is slow in its calculations. Therefore, a segmentation method that utilizes transformers as encoders and convolution as decoders was chosen, namely the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), which can process data in parallel. This research discusses the implementation of the DPT with a case study of the optical disc and cup segmentation on fundus images using the ORIGA dataset. The result shows that DPT is outperformed slightly by the Segmenter model with mIoU at 4.9%.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

Therefore, this study aims to assess the technology readiness of 'My Tuc-Tuc' users, focusing on their readiness across four personality traits: optimism, innovativeness, anxiety, and insecurity. These traits encompass both positive and negative perspectives. The study employed the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) methodology, a well-established framework for evaluating users' readiness to adopt and utilize technology. The selection of participants involved utilizing the Slovin formula, resulting in a sample size of 12 'My Tuc-Tuc' users who also served as TelU Car drivers. Rigorous validity and reliability tests were conducted to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the collected data. Subsequently, the TRI scores were calculated based on the participants' responses. The findings of the study revealed a TRI score of 3.9098, indicating that 'My Tuc-Tuc' users fall within the high technology readiness category according to the TRI classification. This suggests that these users are well-prepared and receptive to the utilization of the 'My Tuc-Tuc' application-based transportation service. The results provide valuable insights for Telkom University and the 'My Tuc-Tuc' team, enabling them to identify and address the challenges faced by users and develop appropriate strategies to enhance the overall user experience and service quality. This study contributes to the existing literature on technology readiness and offers practical implications for the further development and improvement of 'My Tuc-Tuc' as a reliable and user-friendly transportation service.

Furthermore, we also compare the CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model with attention to the BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM models. As a case study, this study used data on the electricity load in Bali, Indonesia. We also compare the experimental results to show that the CNN-BiLSTM with Attention model produces the best accuracy, with a root mean square error of 13.676 and a correlation coefficient 0.993 compared to the other two. These experiments have shown that improving predictions of electricity usage can be achieved by combining the original BiLSTM model with both a CNN layer and an attention mechanism. While the tests conducted primarily focused on short-term forecasting, the CNN-BiLSTM model with an attention mechanism shows potential for further exploration in the realm of intermediate and long-term forecasting.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

            "This paper presents an electromagnetic (EM) decoupling technique for a closely-spaced microstrip patch antenna array. To reduce the EM coupling, a guard trace, a structure consisting of a microstrip line with grounded vias, is inserted between the antenna patches. Parametric studies are carried out to determine the parameters of guard-trace, including the number of vias and the via diameter. To investigate the effectiveness of guard trace utilization for EM coupling reduction, a two-elements microstrip patch antenna array with a guard trace is designed to work at the frequency of 2.4 GHz. While to verify the design, the prototype of microstrip patch antenna array is realized and characterized. Measurement results indicate a coupling reduction of about 5 dB can be achieved when a 4-vias guard trace with the via diameter of 1 mm is inserted between the antenna patches separated by an edge-to-edge distance of 4 mm. Since the strongest coupling reduction occurs at very close distances between antennas, implementation of the proposed concept to massive elements antenna arrays is potential to reduce their footprint.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

In this study, we propose to investigate object detection for underwater surveillance cameras as a means of real-time monitoring and counting of lobsters.

This system consists of three processes: image enhancement with WaterNet as noise reduction, object counting with the YOLOv6\/7\/8 model, and object tracking using StrongSORT. For details, we annotated the lobster data by head only and full body. Our test results show that YOLOv7, with head annotation, has stable mean Average Precision (mAP), making it suitable for the proposed system.

However, an unexplored avenue lies in employing autoencoders for anomaly detection in credit card fraud identification. Our research objective is to apply and assess autoencoders to enhance credit card fraud detection through machine learning-based classification methods. The study utilizes the credit card fraud dataset available on Kaggle, applying various preprocessing techniques such as standardization and over-sampling using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Subsequently, a 5-layer autoencoder is applied to the modified dataset. A novel metric for evaluating reconstruction errors, Mean Decrease in the Impurity of Absolute and Squared Error (MDIASE), is employed for feature selection in the new dataset, combining mean reduction in impurity (MDI), square error, and absolute error concepts. Finally, we assess the influence of the autoencoder on four classification methods: decision tree, KNN, logistic regression, and MLP. The evaluation metrics used for comparison are AUC maximization and geometric mean (g-mean). The test results demonstrate that the autoencoder enhances the performance of four state-of-the-art models in credit card fraud classification.

            "The research about automatic text summarization is common in English text. According to the previous study, automatic text summarization in Bahasa Indonesia is still challenging due to research in this area, especially the research which discusses TextRank algorithm performance, which is still meagerly. Accordingly, this research observes the performance of the TextRank algorithm to summarize the text in Bahasa Indonesia. The TextRank algorithm summarizes a text by sorting out the essential words and relevant sentences regardless of the source language. This algorithm uses a vertex to represent a word. The similarity measurement process will calculate the overlapping words (the same word between two vertices). These overlapping words are represented by the edge, which connects the vertices. Thus, the text forms a graph. This research focuses on the similarity measurement process to determine relevant sentences in a text. As the similarity measurement is critical for the summarization result, this research switches the original process to the Levenshtein Distance algorithm and observes its performance. This research uses the human-produced summarized text by the expert in Bahasa Indonesia linguistics to evaluate the result. The evaluation method is conducted by using ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2. The result shows that the average of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 for the TextRank algorithm is 0.439 and 0.3186, respectively. Meanwhile, the modified TextRank obtains 0.3999 and 0.2805, respectively.

            "The research about automatic text summarization is common in English text. According to the previous study, automatic text summarization in Bahasa Indonesia is still challenging due to research in this area, especially the research which discusses TextRank algorithm performance, which is still meagerly. Accordingly, this research observes the performance of the TextRank algorithm to summarize the text in Bahasa Indonesia. The TextRank algorithm summarizes a text by sorting out the essential words and relevant sentences regardless of the source language. This algorithm uses a vertex to represent a word. The similarity measurement process will calculate the overlapping words (the same word between two vertices). These overlapping words are represented by the edge, which connects the vertices. Thus, the text forms a graph. This research focuses on the similarity measurement process to determine relevant sentences in a text. As the similarity measurement is critical for the summarization result, this research switches the original process to the Levenshtein Distance algorithm and observes its performance. This research uses the human-produced summarized text by the expert in Bahasa Indonesia linguistics to evaluate the result. The evaluation method is conducted by using ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2. The result shows that the average of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 for the TextRank algorithm is 0.439 and 0.3186, respectively. Meanwhile, the modified TextRank obtains 0.3999 and 0.2805, respectively. Both of the algorithms have not shown satisfactory results as expected. \u00a9 IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License"

This coating utilized cellulose nanofibers (CNF) of 1% to create pathways for the corrosion inhibitors sodium alginate (Alg) and calcium nitrite (CN). These pathways allowed the release of Alg and CN to damaged areas for corrosion protection. Electrochemical impedance of scratches to the coatings was monitored in corrosive solutions to evaluate the self-healing properties of the polymer coatings. The positions of the Alg and CN layers in the coatings were instrumental in the effectiveness of corrosion protection to the damaged areas. As a result, the CN layer was the first to spread to the damaged area, and the Alg layer followed. The combination formed a coating of 8% CN layer and 5% Alg layer with CNF that delivered excellent self-healing properties. The corrosion inhibitors first formed a thin film via nitride ions, which was followed by a well-adhered thick film composed of alginates and calcium ions. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

Abnormalities in the heart can usually be detected when there is an additional sound during an incomplete valve opening. Additional sounds in cardiac abnormalities can be called murmurs. Normal and murmur heart sound happen in different frequency. Therefore, frequency-based feature extraction can be used to classify heart sound. One of frequency domains is power spectrum that can be calculated for power by two frequency of signal, and it can clearly show the pattern of murmur and normal heart sound. In this research, the proposed feature extraction based on the power spectrum feature is used to become another option feature extraction for heart sound classification, which is different from previous heart sound classification studies. There are five types of feature extraction that developed base power spectrum, which are Mean Frequency, Total Power, Maximum Peak Frequency, 1st Spectral Moment, and 2nd Spectral moment. Several classifiers also are used to get the best classier base that features. The best selection feature of this research is Mean Frequency, with best classifier are Stochastic Gradient Descent and logistic regression and accuracy 93%. When all features are used for classifier, almost all of the models have the highest accuracy especially when classifier with mean frequency, 1st Spectral, and 2nd Spectral moment has good accuracy too.

This personality factor is mapped using C4.5 to get a job that matches your personality. The work fields based on the 20 Job Families are taken from the O*NET database. The system runs according to its purpose with accuracy of 99.99%. For further research, the development will be combined with other personality tests, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator so that personality assessment has a broader scope. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

By taking account of the company\u2019s financial ratios, this study intends to determine which the finest financial distress prediction model is for industrial sector companies in Indonesia. This research used samples from the industrial sector on the In-donesian Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2021 and a predictor variable in the form of financial ratios to compare the accuracy of the artificial neural networks (ANN) and the logit models in predicting financial distress. The ratios in the following categories are applied for generating predictions: current ratio (CR), return on assets (ROA), debt to asset ratio (DAR), total asset turnover (TATO), and cash flow to debt ratio.

The objective of this research is to develop a prediction model for air condition outside Telkom University Landmark Tower (TULT) using the Internet of Things (IoT) approach and Regression Tree Ensembles (RTE). In this study, the RTE technique is employed as the prediction method that combines multiple regression trees to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Historical data collected from the TULT building serves as the training dataset for the model. To assess the model's performance, evaluation is conducted utilizing the R-squared ($R^{2}$) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) methods to quantify the error. The evaluation on temperature measurements show that the model achieves a low MAE of 0.28608 in the test data. In the training data, the MAE is even lower, at 0.00397. For humidity measurements, the model exhibits a higher MAE of 7.0043 in the test data, indicating higher error rates in humidity predictions. Similarly, the MAE in the training data is 0.1086, showing that the model performs better on the data it was trained on but still experiences higher errors in the test data. In terms of $R^{2}$ values, the model achieves an $R^{2}$ of 0.3159 in the test data for temperature measurement, indicating that it can explain approximately 31.59% of the variance in temperature data. In the training data, the $R^{2}$ value is much higher at 0.9949. Interested readers can use the data from this website https:\/\/socj.telkomuniversity.ac.id\/data\/.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "Glaucoma is a condition of the eyes that results from damage to the optic nerve, which could potentially lead to loss of vision if not addressed promptly. Because glaucoma rarely shows early symptoms in the sufferer, it requires regular observation of the retinal fundus by an ophthalmologist to find out if this eye disorder appears. Doctors' observations are subjective, so they are inconsistent and take a long time. As a result, a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system was created that can automate the examination of retinal fundus images to detect glaucoma in its initial phase. In a consistent and time-saving manner by using optic disc and cup segmentation and cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) computation. CAD systems can also be used as decision support by doctors. Several previous image segmentation studies have proposed using convolution neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) based models and their combinations. However, the encoder-decoder model based on CNN is large and is slow in computation. The ViT model has the problem that the computational amount of the model increases when the image size also increases. Therefore, the segmentation method uses a Swin Transformer-based encoder-decoder model, Swin-Unet, which has the advantage of a self-attention mechanism performed on local windows and has linear computation. This paper presents a case study of optical disc and cup segmentation using the Swin-Unet method with the REFUGE dataset. The vCDR calculation with a threshold of 0.63 yields an accuracy of 94%. The IoU score results using the REFUGE dataset resulted in a score of 84% for the disc part and 80% for the cup part.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

            "Currently several industries are starting to try to apply metaverse in various possible implementations, such as manufacturing, health, business, education and training, architecture, and entertainment. For business in a smaller context, metaverse can be used to interact with other users in virtual meetings and predicted to be able to replace the current concept of online communication using video conferencing. The question is are the employees have intention to work within metaverse environment in the future, and what will be the barrier and the driver for employees to work within metaverse environment To answer this question, a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis methodology was carried out using a modified dual factor model approach. In this study it is also proposed to add environmental factors which are also a part in a decision-making process. The research result shows that the application of the metaverse in the company does not necessarily need to be driven by external factors. Instead, the company's independence determines its adaptation to the technology. From this study, it was obtained that the factors in the dual factor model had a significant or no significant effect on the intention to work within metaverse. By validity, reliability, and path coefficient tests on research model proposed, it is determined the readiness and interest of employees to switch to work within metaverse. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

The tourism industry must adopt sustainable business practices and improve its performance to overcome this. Support system facilities, stakeholders, and the application of open innovation can help increase optimal performance and support in achieving a sustainable tourism industry. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to propose a collaborative model of open innovation, stakeholders, and support system facilities to develop a sustainable tourism industry in a dynamic and competitive environment. This study uses quantitative methods for analysis. The sampling technique used purposive sampling with the criteria of SMEs scattered around the tourist area. The research model was analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using data from 358 respondents from SMEs in the tourist area of Rembang Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, and Banyuwangi Regency, East Java, Indonesia. The study results show that performance improvements can significantly and positively affect the sustainability of the tourism industry ( \\beta = 0.530; p = 0.005, p \u2264 0.05). The tourism industry's performance can be achieved by implementing open innovation, participation of stakeholders, support system facilities, and environmental dynamism (p \u2264 0.05). However, environmental competitiveness is not proven to improve the tourism industry's performance ( \\beta = 0.022; p = 0.120, p \u2265 0.05), because every organization and stakeholder is interdependent. Theoretically, this research contributes to the debate about how open innovation, stakeholders, support system facilities, and environmental dynamism can improve tourism's performance, ultimately achieving a sustainable industry.

Furthermore, the current studies of suitable concepts and test protocols for roof tile transportation at the manufacturing stage as well as their inspection systems are not practicable in Indonesia. There is also no study that has used the theory of inventive problem-solving (TRIZ) in the development of concepts and protocols for roof tile transportation and inspection systems. Using TRIZ as a supporting tool, this study investigated the development of a transportation system to be employed during the manufacturing of the roof tile and a test protocol for their usability in Indonesian companies to overcome this concern. The study included screening and scoring concepts and usability test protocols identified from the existing literature, with the support of TRIZ tools such as the engineering contradiction, contradiction matrix, and inventive principles. Thus, the finalised concept comprised a belt conveyor system (Inventive Principle 20: Continuity of Useful Action) with a flipping mechanism for transportation and a vision-based camera for inspection. Results of the study showed that the concept excelled in cost, durability, reliability, versatility, low risk to the product, efficiency, and safety.

In this study, we statistically evaluated 21 sampling methods on 100 imbalanced data sets with a range of imbalance ratio (IR) values varying from 1.82 to 129.44.

            "Intense precipitation events are the main cause triggering hydrometeorological hazards over complex terrain. Two extreme precipitation (EP) events led to major flooding on 23\u201325 March 2021 and produced a rain-hail mixture (RHM) on 11 April 2021 in the Greater Bandung (GB) basin area, Indonesia. We investigated the spatial and vertical structure of precipitating cloud systems and the plausible mechanism triggering the two case studies with combined multiple remote sensing observations using an X-band polarimetric Doppler Weather Radar (Xpol) and X-band rain scanner radar (RSR) network, supported by rain gauges and satellite observation. The local processes controlling the intense rainfall events over the complex topography were quantified for the first time using an observational campaign in Indonesia. During the first EP event (23\u201325 March 2021), the modified satellite algorithm successively confirmed that the mesoscale convective system triggered the local anomalous circulation. The RSR network reveals that the EP in eastern GB contributed to the overflow of the Citarum River alongside the basin, coinciding with the eastward propagating convective system that produced oblate-shaped water droplets without hail. Nevertheless, during the second EP event on 11 April 2021, the strengthening of mountain-based convection played a main role in producing RHM, confirmed by a hail differential reflectivity larger than 12 dB and exhibited hail early stage over two height levels in different locations (981 m and 1033 m) in the GB. Our study also found Doppler vorticity-based and rain sizes combination indicators using RSR data networks in capturing such extreme weather events over complex topography with 35 min early times to support the early warning system of hydrometeorological disaster mitigation over GB, Indonesia. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

These threats can be prevented if the reader can verify the message's content integrity and source authenticity. One recent solution to overcome these threats was proposed by Ahvanooey et al. called ANiTW. ANiTW uses an invisible text watermarking scheme to verify social media message integrity and identify the message source. However, ANiTW is still vulnerable to undetected malicious text modification. Moreover, ANiTW has no tools to authenticate the extracted message source. The proposed method aims to overcome those vulnerabilities and improve ANiTW performance as a tool to verify message content integrity and message source authenticity in social media. To overcome vulnerabilities in ANITW, a part of the message hash and IBS-based signature is introduced as the watermark. The message integrity is verifiable by using part of the message hash as a watermark to detect any malicious. Moreover, implementing an IBS-based signature enables any reader to verify the message source's authenticity easily. In addition, to improve ANITW performance in embedding capacity and invisibility, a novel bigram-based character encoding and embedding rule are also introduced.

Wever is able to display and visualize 100% data accurately which being sent and stored from Antares to Firebase. The performance quality of LoRaWAN Antares is on high performance at 50m distance with RSSI value around - 75.36 dBm for SF 7 and -93.94 dBm for SF 11. The further the distance the greater SF value is needed. SF 11 at 250m distance could transmit 36 out of 40 data in measurement time span. While SF 7 lost about 77.5% data within the time span. Greater SF means greater power consumption and low bit rate. Using an appropriate SF could increase battery life while maintain the system functionality. The SNR value is greater than -18 dB, while Lora could demodulate signal until -20 dB below the noise floor. Overall delay never hit 0.09 ms means the data transmission is nearly instant and consistent.

Frequent Pattern-Growth (FP-Growth) Association Rule Algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for managing assets effectively. This algorithm is used to identify frequent patterns in large datasets, making it an efficient method for discovering association rules to help organizations make informed decisions about their assets. In the context of asset management, FP-Growth Association Rule Algorithms can be used to identify patterns in asset usage, maintenance, and replacement. By analyzing historical data, the algorithm can identify which assets are most frequently used, which require the most maintenance, and which are most likely to fail.

The proposed management asset tools are built on an Android operating system smartphone. This research using 30%, 60%, and 80% minimum support. The experiment results show that the minimum support affects the time needed to build an association. A small minimum support requires a longer time, while a large minimum support requires a faster time. The confidence value is used to determine the relevance of the FP-Growth output results. The results of the tests show that the difference in minimum support affects the speed of building associations, and the confidence value is proportional to the minimum support used.

            "Several studies have conducted countermeasures against message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) attacks. However, existing research needs to examine further the imbalanced dataset that occurs in flood attacks, where these conditions can affect attack detection performance. Our research aim is to utilize the area under curve (AUC) maximization for flood attack detection on MQTT with imbalanced datasets. We leverage datasets from existing papers for flood attacks and legitimate network data. Then we utilize the AUC maximization methodology as follows: we perform parameter tuning of three machine learning methods: gradient boosting, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Then we measure the performance of each model with the receiver operating curve (ROC) and AUC. We repeated these steps by performing parameter tuning and feature selection until the optimum AUC was found. Our test results show that the f1-score test can be used in the majority class but gives poor results in the minority class. At the same time, AUC shows that gradient boosting is the optimum detection method compared to naive Bayes and KNN, with AUCs of 0.96, 0.86, and 0.77, respectively. Finally, testing with feature selection shows that feature selection can increase AUC and decrease training and testing time by reducing features from 33 to two, revealing that the prominent features in a flood attack are tcp.len and tcp.time_delta.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

To complement that, rather than using the classic geometrical approach (such as multilateration), it uses a more data-driven approach, i.e., the location fingerprinting technique. The fingerprint of a location, in this case, is a set of Wi-Fi ToFs between the target device and an access point (AP). Therefore, the number of APs in the area dictates the set size. The location fingerprinting technique requires a collection of fingerprints of various locations in the area to build a reference database or map. This database or map contains the information used to carry out the main task of the location fingerprinting technique, namely, estimating the position of a device based on its location fingerprint. For that task, we propose using a fully connected deep neural network (FCDNN) model to act as a positioning engine. The model is given a location fingerprint as its input to produce the estimated location coordinates as its output. We conduct an experiment to analyze the impact of the available AP pair in the dataset, from 1 unique AP pair, 2 AP pairs, and more, using WKNN and FCDNN to compare their performance. Our experimental results show that our IPS, DeepIndoor, can achieve an average positioning error or mean square error of 0.1749 m, and root mean square error of 0.5740 m in scenario 3, where 1-10 AP pairs or the raw dataset is used.  \u00a9 2023 Doan Perdana et al."

Therefore, cyber resilience is a fundamental attribute to ensure controlled human, environmental, and physical process security. By utilizing a thorough investigation and a cyber resilience matrix, this research examines the existing literature to seize the fundamental concepts of cyber resilience. The assessment focuses on measuring the capacity to recuperate from cyber threats and emphasizes the significance of offerings like reacting to unforeseen events, collecting information, and safeguarding strategies. As cyber resilience is closely associated with the internet, it plays a crucial role in shaping the future and revolutionizing our lives through technology. Cyber resilience will always be present alongside the increasing use and development of technology. However, at the level of either good or bad, it depends on several factors, cyber resilience begins with the awareness that it will become a culture, then cyber resilience is born. With that, cybersecurity and cyber resilience need to be continually updated. This study found a lack of research on cyber resilience as well as discussions that approached this science, and received less attention compared to other disciplines.  \u00a9 2023 ACM."

An accurate diagnosis of epilepsy is essential to the treatment and management of the patient's condition. Electroencephalography EEG is a non-invasive technique for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Data analysis and processing can be challenging due to the high dimensionality of EEG signals. In this study, the dimensionality reduction technique using compressive sensing is applied to EEG signals to optimize the process and improve the accuracy of the classification in the epileptic EEG signals. The CS method is applied to minimize processed data by reducing EEG signal dimensions, and energy is calculated on the compressed signal as a feature. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using SVM with Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, and Radian Basis Function kernels through 5- and 10-fold cross-validation.

To address this, the study introduces a solution by employing the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Internet of Things (IoT) methods to accurately model humidity and temperature conditions at different heights on TULT.

The results showcased the effectiveness of the approach, with temperature measurements producing a low MAE value of 1.7869 and a negligible MBE value of 0.0506 for the training data. Likewise, humidity measurements revealed an MAE value of 13.3275 and an MBE value of 0.1837 for training data, further confirming the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model.

            "Background: Airport service quality and service orientation are important aspects of managing passenger satisfaction and airport image. The aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of service orientation and airport service quality on airport image through passenger satisfaction as an intervention variable. Methods: The survey was conducted on 356 passengers at the departure area and lounge. Samples were taken at five major airports in Indonesia, including Soekarno Hatta International Airport. To test the influence of exogenous variables on endogenous variables through intervening variables, a quantitative testing analysis test was carried out using the structural equation model partial least square (SEM-PLS). Result: The research results show that service orientation has a significant and positive effect on airport service quality, passenger satisfaction, and airport image. Moreover, service quality also has a positive effect on passenger satisfaction and the airport\u2019s image. Empirically, passenger satisfaction has been proven to mediate the influence of service quality and service orientation on airport image. It has been proven that airport operators who focus on passengers through service orientation can increase passenger satisfaction and the airport\u2019s image. Conclusions: Focusing on passengers\u2019 needs while at the airport is an important aspect for airport operators who aim to manage their emotions, which encourages passengers to use paid services while in the waiting room. The use of this paid service will directly increase the airport\u2019s aeronautical revenue. Future research needs to consider the influence of image on purchase intention and return to the airport. \u00a9 2023 by the authors.",

            "Sustainable development in the tourism industry is a significant challenge requiring various stakeholders' collaborative efforts. The tourism industry must adopt sustainable business practices and improve its performance to overcome this. Support system facilities, stakeholders, and the application of open innovation can help increase optimal performance and support in achieving a sustainable tourism industry. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to propose a collaborative model of open innovation, stakeholders, and support system facilities to develop a sustainable tourism industry in a dynamic and competitive environment. This study uses quantitative methods for analysis. The sampling technique used purposive sampling with the criteria of SMEs scattered around the tourist area. The research model was analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using data from 358 respondents from SMEs in the tourist area of Rembang Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, and Banyuwangi Regency, East Java, Indonesia. The study results show that performance improvements can significantly and positively affect the sustainability of the tourism industry ( \\beta = 0.530; p = 0.005, p \u2264 0.05). The tourism industry's performance can be achieved by implementing open innovation, participation of stakeholders, support system facilities, and environmental dynamism (p \u2264 0.05). However, environmental competitiveness is not proven to improve the tourism industry's performance ( \\beta = 0.022; p = 0.120, p \u2265 0.05), because every organization and stakeholder is interdependent. Theoretically, this research contributes to the debate about how open innovation, stakeholders, support system facilities, and environmental dynamism can improve tourism's performance, ultimately achieving a sustainable industry. Practically, this research benefits stakeholders and SMEs in formulating an appropriate policy for achieving a green industry.  \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

The engine was operated with the blends of B10, B20, and B30 with 5% graphene nano additives (designated as B10G5, B20G5, and B30G5). To find the parameter's optimum values, the Desirability Function approach (DFA), Swarm Salp single objective, Multi Objective Bat algorithm (MOBA), Response surface methodology (RSM) and D-optimal design approach were employed. Advanced machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to anticipate these characteristics. It was found that B20G5 had a better brake thermal efficiency (BTE), when compared to the other samples (and around 11% higher than diesel fuel at full load). The emissions of Carbon monoxide (CO) and Hydrocarbon (HC) were lower for B20G5 blended fuel than for diesel (Around 23.52% lower than diesel). In comparison to Response surface methodology (RSM), the overall coefficient of determination (R2) value using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for was high. As a result, it was revealed that the ANN was typically better than the RSM in forecasting the various factors affecting the engine performance. The optimum outcomes were achieved by single objective (Salp Swarm algorithm) and multi-objective algorithms. According to multi-objective algorithm, a B20G5 nano additive biodiesel mix at its maximum Brake power (BP) produced the highest value of BTE with the lowest Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions. The comparison shows that B20G5 can be used easily without making any modifications to engines. \u00a9 2023 The Authors",

This study presents an in-depth analysis of business goals, IT processes, and IT risks in the case of a pharmaceutical company through which appropriate controls are designed to ensure business value creation through IT. Drawing on a case study of a pharmaceutical company in Indonesia, we found that managing IT risks in the pharmaceutical industry entails two main objectives: 1) ensuring compliance with external laws and regulations as well as internal policies, 2) supporting the optimization of business functions, processes, and costs. Throughout one year of engagement during the project, this study identified ten risks associated with the operation of business processes. Risks are dominated by moderate levels given the current state of controls and appetite, most of which emerge from the company\u2019s existing internal processes.

It delineates the developmental stages into three components aligned with Berger and Luckmann\u2019s social construction theory: externalisation, objectification, and internalisation. Using qualitative methods and field studies, data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with three religious leaders from two eco-pesantren in Banten Province. Externalization is exemplified by the kyai\u2019s teachings on humanity as caliphs, advocating against harming the Earth, emphasizing cleanliness as integral to faith, and prioritising \u1e6dahh\u0101rah in fiqh. Objectification is seen in the prohibition of deforestation and embedded environmental preservation duties within the schools\u2019 hidden curriculum. Internalisation reflects practical implementation aligned with established objectives, observed through growing pro-environmental consciousness, attitudes, and behaviours among school members, evolving progressively. This construction of ecological devotion resulted in tangible contributions to groundwater conservation and flood risk mitigation by the two schools. The findings highlight Islamic boarding schools\u2019 potential to elevate environmental standards via fiqh al-b\u012b\u2019ah-rooted ecological wisdom. Collaborative efforts involving stakeholders, such as financial support and training programmes, are vital to enhancing the environmental management capacity, particularly in establishing impactful water management systems within these institutions. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk mengeksplorasi proses konstruksi realitas sosial kesalehan ekologis di lingkungan pesantren oleh para kyai sebagai wujud penerapan fiqh al-b\u012b\u2019ah. Peneliti memilah proses konstruksi menjadi tiga komponen sesuai dengan teori konstruksi sosial realitas dari Berger dan Luckmann, yaitu eksternalisasi, objektivikasi, dan internalisasi. Penelitian ini didesain menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan studi lapangan. Data penelitian didapatkan dengan wawancara semi terstruktur dengan tiga tokoh agama di dua eko-pesantren di Provinsi Banten. Eksternalisasi diketahui muncul dalam bentuk penafsiran para kyai terhadap peran manusia sebagai khal\u012bfah dan larangan berbuat kerusakan di muka Bumi, adagium bahwa kebersihan adalah sebagian dari iman, dan penempatan \u1e6dahh\u0101rah sebagai bagian awal untuk memasuki fiqh. Adapun bentuk objektivikasi adalah larangan menebang pohon dan kewajiban-kewajiban yang terarah pada upaya memelihara lingkungan hidup di pesantren yang diprogram sebagai kurikulum tersembunyi di pesantren. Internalisasi yang terjadi merupakan praktik nyata di lapangan yang sesuai dengan objektivikasi yang telah dibuat dan dijadwalkan. Internalisasi ditunjukkan dengan kesadaran, sikap, dan perilaku yang pro-lingkungan pada hampir semua orang di dalam pesantren dan berlangsung secara progresif seiring waktu. Dampak yang lebih luas dari proses konstruksi kesalehan ekologis ini adalah kontribusi nyata kedua pesantren dalam konservasi air tanah maupun mitigasi risiko banjir. Temuan penelitian ini mengindikasikan bahwa pesantren dapat berpartisipasi dalam meningkatkan kualitas lingkungan hidup lewat konstruksi kearifan ekologis berbasis fiqh al-b\u012b\u2019ah.

We used non-return to zero (NRZ) modulation to achieve high bit rates up to 2 Gbps and evaluated the performance using bit error rate (BER) analysis.

Several factors that support the growth of nursery plants are nutritional factors, sunlight, temperature, soil pH, water, and soil moisture. In terms of effectiveness and ease of access to information in monitoring the supporting condition factors and facilitating the farmers, an Android-based monitoring system was built to monitor the growth of nursery plants. The system consists of several sensors, such as a soil pH sensor, UV light sensor, and soil moisture sensor embedded with Raspberry pi and firebase. The proposed system was examined on a plantation area of 900 square meters. The testing is conducted by placing a combination of 4 to 8 sensors in the plantation area. Data from each sensor is processed by calculating the average, and the results are rounded to the nearest value. The test stated that to monitor an area of 900 square meters, the area with five sensors implanted can be used as the optimal implementation. Apart from economic reasons, the minor rounding error equals 8.25% compared to the number of other sensors. The results that are informed to the farmers are also within the appropriate range.

In terms of effectiveness and ease of access to information in monitoring the supporting condition factors and facilitating the farmers, an Android-based monitoring system was built to monitor the growth of nursery plants. The system consists of several sensors, such as a soil pH sensor, UV light sensor, and soil moisture sensor embedded with Raspberry pi and firebase. The proposed system was examined on a plantation area of 900 square meters. The testing is conducted by placing a combination of 4 to 8 sensors in the plantation area. Data from each sensor is processed by calculating the average, and the results are rounded to the nearest value. The test stated that to monitor an area of 900 square meters, the area with five sensors implanted can be used as the optimal implementation. Apart from economic reasons, the minor rounding error equals 8.25% compared to the number of other sensors. The results that are informed to the farmers are also within the appropriate range. There are no significant differences, and this approach can be used to implement in a broader area. \u00a9 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

            "This paper introduced a novel metaheuristic that is developed based on the tournament mechanism, namely quad tournament optimizer (QTO). As its name suggests, QTO proposes a new approach of metaheuristic in which there are four searches conducted by each agent in every iteration. These searches are: (1) searching toward the global best solution, (2) searching toward the middle between the global best solution and a randomly selected solution, (3) searching relative to a randomly selected solution, and (4) neighbourhood search around the corresponding solution and the global best solution. A solution candidate is generated by each search. Then, a tournament is carried out to find the best candidate. This strategy is novel because most of metaheuristic deploys only single search or multiple searches where each search is conducted sequentially. QTO is challenged to find the optimal solution of 23 classic functions. In this challenge, QTO is benchmarked against five shortcoming metaheuristics: marine predator algorithm (MPA), slime mould algorithm (SMA), golden search optimizer (GSO), hybrid pelican Komodo algorithm (HPKA), and guided pelican algorithm (GPA). The result indicates that QTO outperforms all these benchmark metaheuristics. QTO is better than MPA, SMA, GSO, HPKA, and GPA in solving 22, 19, 21, 20, and 13 functions consecutively. The result also indicates that QTO has successfully found the global optimal solution for nine functions: Sphere, Schwefel 2.22, Schwefel 1.2, Schwefel 2.21, Rastrigin, Griewank, Six Hump Camel, Branin, and Goldstein-Price. \u00a9 2023,International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.All Rights Reserved.",

Traditionally, medicinal plants play a major role to help treat, cure, and prevent various disease in the community around the world. Brunei flora is quite wealthy with various plants with medicinal benefits. These plants are more renowned today as people have more knowledge and more research has been conducted to study them. Among the issues related to the use of medicinal plants directly or in fresh form is that the content of the medicinal substance could be inconsistent, hence the effectiveness of the medication is also inconsistent. This is especially true if the plants are grown naturally, and not cultivated specifically for pharmaceutical purposes. Therefore, it is the main objective of this research to learn the best farming practice for a living pharmacy and to design a smart farming system that is suitable to grow these local medicinal plants specifically, to cater not only for the farmers, but for anyone who are interested in growing their own medicinal plants that are suitable for the weather condition in Brunei Darussalam. In this research, experiment is done to a set of five different medicinal plants. Two types of organic fertilizers are used to treat the plants, avoiding the use of chemical substances. Electronic sensors are used to monitor the soil condition and solar energy is used to power the sensors and other electronic circuits within the automated monitoring and maintenance system of the plants. Wi-Fi application that allows users to monitor remotely, the data from the system is also developed.

The presence of voids can affect the mechanical properties and increase the potential damage of the composite. Voids possess micrometer size and various shapes, which requires a micrometer resolution technique for identification. This study aims to identify, classify, and count the number of voids in resin-covered fiberglass composite digital images, as well as to correlate the voids with the composite tensile strength. For that purpose, we applied the template matching method in digital image processing combining with the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) method to analyze the digital images of the composites prepared by dry-, wet-, and rolled-lay-up methods. We observed various shapes and sizes of voids present in the composite surface and correlated them with the composite tensile strength. Even t hough the samples are prepared with the same fabrication processes, the number of voids on each sample are varied. However, only voids with a diameter size larger than 70\u03bcm were found to influence the tensile strength strongly. The composite tensile strength tends to decrease with the increase of large voids numbers, whereas no consistent relation is observed between the number of small voids and tensile strength. We also found that RGB image templates are more accurate for localized void identification with a strong contrast with its surrounding.

So a computer-Aided diagnostic (CAD) system was built to detect glaucoma early on, fundus image analysis automation, time efficiency through optical disc and cup segmentation, and Cup to Disc Ratio (CDR) calculations. Several previous studies have proposed using models based on Vision Transformers (ViT), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and a combination of the two. However, the ViT model has problems: The number of model computations increases when the image size also increases, and the CNN-based encoder-decoder model has a large size and is slow in its calculations.

This research discusses the implementation of the DPT with a case study of the optical disc and cup segmentation on fundus images using the ORIGA dataset. The result shows that DPT is outperformed slightly by the Segmenter model with mIoU at 4.9%.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

The investigation of information systems within the context of non-profit organizations offers a promising avenue for advancing the field of information systems research. This study focuses on the development of an information systems framework using the soft systems methodology, which has already been established.

Excellent human resources and adequate digital infrastructure are requirements in an Economic Society 5.0. Cooperatives as community economic organizations are players in the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Because of low competitiveness, cooperatives cannot create new and sustainable income streams, particularly digitalization capabilities. This study aims to encourage the competitiveness of cooperatives in the West Java region, Indonesia, in an Economic Society 5.0 by identifying the correlation between digital capabilities, digital orientation, employee resistance, government support, digital innovation and competitiveness. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study uses a quantitative method through surveys as data collection techniques by distributing questionnaires to 386 leaders of cooperatives in West Java. Hypothesis testing uses analysis technique of structural equation modeling with partial least squares tool. Findings: There are five hypotheses that are supported in the proposed model in this study. Digital orientation and government support have a positif and significant effect on digital innovation, in contrary; digital capability and employee resistance do not show any effect. Digital orientation, government support and digital capability also have a positive and significant effect on competitiveness. Meanwhile, employee resistance and digital innovation have no significant effect on competitiveness. Digital innovation was also found not to mediate the relationship between digital orientation, government support, digital capability and employee resistance with competitiveness. Originality\/value: This study provides new insights into the study of cooperatives as community\u2019s economic institutions. This study adds empirical evidence of the factors that influence the competitiveness of cooperative institutions in Indonesia as a driver of the community\u2019s economy. This study also provides practical implications for the development of cooperative competitiveness in developing countries, particularly in Indonesia. \u00a9 2021, Ratri Wahyuningtyas, Ganjar Disastra and Risris Rismayani.",

Excellent human resources and adequate digital infrastructure are requirements in an Economic Society 5.0. Cooperatives as community economic organizations are players in the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Because of low competitiveness, cooperatives cannot create new and sustainable income streams, particularly digitalization capabilities. This study aims to encourage the competitiveness of cooperatives in the West Java region, Indonesia, in an Economic Society 5.0 by identifying the correlation between digital capabilities, digital orientation, employee resistance, government support, digital innovation and competitiveness.

Several commercially-available wearable devices have recently been equipped with a BP monitoring feature. However, concerns about recalibration remain. Pulse transit time (PTT)-based estimation is required for initial calibration, followed by periodic recalibration. Recalibration using arm-cuff BP monitors is not practical during everyday activities. In this study, we investigated recalibration using PTT-based BP monitoring aided by a deep neural network (DNN) and validated the performance achieved with more practical wrist-cuff BP monitors. The PTT-based prediction produced a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.746 \u00b1 1.529 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 3.448 \u00b1 0.608 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when tested with an arm-cuff monitor employing recalibration. Recalibration clearly improved the performance of both DNN and conventional linear regression approaches. We established that the periodic recalibration performed by a wrist-worn BP monitor could be as accurate as that obtained with an arm-worn monitor, confirming the suitability of wrist-worn devices for everyday use. This is the first study to establish the potential of wrist-cuff BP monitors as a means to calibrate BP monitoring devices that can reliably substitute for arm-cuff BP monitors.

The DE analysis shows that the rateless capability with the extended parity successfully correct the error for higher e, without suffering from the error-floor (although many degree-1s exist), but slightly loose in gap from the Shannon limit.

Employees' knowledge as an important domain of the organization is an essential asset to build an organizational competitive advantage, increase innovation, and provide a valuable contribution to a company. The role of knowledge management is needed in an effort to achieve those goals. Many companies do not yet realize the importance of knowledge management. Even though there have been efforts to implement knowledge management, it is still limited. One example is the company that is our case study which does a knowledge management process traditionally, relying on face-to-face meetings and communication, face-to-face knowledge sharing, and storing a documentation file only in Google Drive. Employee knowledge is not managed properly by the company, resulting in less-than-optimal utilization of employee knowledge. Therefore, the company needs an information system as a platform for managing employee knowledge. Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) can be developed to support the optimization of the knowledge management process. This study aims to build a web based KMS for the company. As a result, the KMS was developed and deployed successfully. Three main activities were successfully carried out by utilizing the KMS, that are preserving, sharing, and enhancing the knowledge of employees. The system has also been tested and successfully passed all test scenarios. The results of this study can be taken into consideration by other researchers or practitioners who will develop KMS in the future. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Employees' knowledge as an important domain of the organization is an essential asset to build an organizational competitive advantage, increase innovation, and provide a valuable contribution to a company. The role of knowledge management is needed in an effort to achieve those goals. Many companies do not yet realize the importance of knowledge management. Even though there have been efforts to implement knowledge management, it is still limited. One example is the company that is our case study which does a knowledge management process traditionally, relying on face-to-face meetings and communication, face-to-face knowledge sharing, and storing a documentation file only in Google Drive. Employee knowledge is not managed properly by the company, resulting in less-than-optimal utilization of employee knowledge.

Based on this circumstance, this work constructs a new metaheuristic called as migrating walrus algorithm (MWA) based on the hybridization of both MA and WaOA to create a better metaheuristic than them. MWA consists of five migrations: four directed migrations and one local migration. The references used in these directed migrations are the best walrus, a randomly picked better walrus, a randomly picked walrus, and two randomly picked walruses. In this work, two assessments are carried out: the comparative assessment and the individual migration assessment. The 23 functions are selected as theoretical use cases. In the comparative assessment, MWA is confronted with five new metaheuristics: MA, WaOA, attack leave optimization (ALO), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and osprey optimization algorithm (OOA). The result shows that MWA is better than ALO, COA, MA, OOA, and WaOA in 19, 19, 19, 17, and 17 functions. On the other hand, the individual migration assessment result indicates that the multiple migration approach is important to maintain the superiority of MWA with the directed migration toward the best walrus becoming the most important contributor.

            "Question Generation (QG) is a task to generate questions based on an input context. Question Generation can be solved in several ways, ranging from conventional rule-based systems to recently emerging sequence-to-sequence approaches. The limitation of most QG systems is its limitation on input form, which is mainly only on text data. On the other hand, Multimodal QG covers several different inputs such as: text, image, table, video, or even acoustics. In this paper, we present our proposed method to handle the Multimodal Question Generation task using an attachment to a BERT-based model called Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG). The results show that using the proposed method, this development succeeds to do a Multimodal Question Generation task. The generated questions give 16.05 BLEU 4 and 28.27 ROUGE-L scores, accompanied by the human evaluation to judge the generated questions from the model, resulting in 55% fluency and 53% relevance. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

The increasing demand for automatic proctoring services raises challenges related to handling growing traffic, server failures, and ensuring fair resource utilization. This study investigates the performance of an automatic proctoring load balancing system to address these challenges, focusing on key metrics such as response times, request distribution, and failover times. The system utilizes a Round Robin load balancing algorithm to effectively manage incoming requests and distribute them among multiple proctoring engines. The evaluation reveals a 22.22% decrease in response times, ensuring low latency and improved efficiency. Additionally, the algorithm evenly distributes requests across the proctoring engines, enabling fair resource utilization and adaptability to varying workloads. Despite an increase in failover times with the number of requests, the system maintains an average failover time of 700 ms, demonstrating resilience in handling server failures and ensuring uninterrupted service. Overall, the automatic proctoring load balancing system offers a more efficient, scalable, and resilient proctoring infrastructure capable of addressing the challenges of increasing traffic and server failures.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

Unfortunately, almost all metaheuristics are not equipped with an adaptive approach that makes them change their strategy when stagnation happens during iteration. Based on this consideration, a new metaheuristic, called an adaptive balance optimizer (ABO), is proposed in this paper. ABO's unique strategy focuses on exploitation when improvement happens and switching to exploration during stagnation. ABO also uses a balanced strategy between exploration and exploitation by performing two sequential searches, whatever circumstance it faces. These sequential searches consist of one guided search and one random search. Moreover, ABO also deploys both a strict acceptance approach and a non-strict acceptance approach. In this work, ABO is challenged to solve a set of 23 classic functions as a theoretical optimization problem and a portfolio optimization problem as the use case for the practical optimization problem. In portfolio optimization, ABO should optimize the quantity of ten stocks in the energy and mining sector listed in the IDX30 index.

            "Covid-19 pandemic has created a mobile transaction trend among the Indonesian community. One of the widely used e-wallet or digital wallet applications in Indonesia is FLIP. FLIP is a financial technology (fintech) application from Depok, Indonesia. FLIP emphasizes \"free interbank transfers\"as its main selling point. In addition, FLIP also provides other features such as fee-free e-wallet top-ups and cost-effective international money transfers. FLIP currently is used by more than 12 million users. The researchers aim to particularize the acceptance degree of the FLIP application among the Indonesian society in the post-Covid-19 pandemic era using the modified UTAUT2 method based on previous research. The researchers used the Price Saving Orientation variable to replace Price Value variable. Trust is included as additional variable. The data for this research was obtained from 393 respondents across Indonesia. This study, use quantitative method with Factor Analysis and Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) using smartPLS 4. This research shows that Trust & Habit has the greatest positive significant impact towards Continuance Intention. However, Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Hedonic Motivation do not significantly impact the intention to continue using FLIP. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Introducing dance to elementary school-level children is one way to maintain and preserve regional culture. However, the limited learning time causes the material to be delivered less in-depth, so students feel bored, lose motivation, and get some critical information from the material. This study aims to build a mobile-based learning application for Jaipong dance learning activities at the elementary school level using the User-Centered Design (UCD) method. The application evaluation involved fifteen public elementary school students in Ciamis, West Java. Participants were asked to answer a quantitative survey using the Quality Use Integrated Measurement (QUIM) instrument to discover their experience using the application during Jaipong dance lessons. The test results get an average score of 91%, included in the \"excellent\" category. These results were strengthened by the user's understanding of the Jaipong dance. As many as 86.7% of users who use the Jaipong dance learning application understand the material well. In contrast, only 33.3% of YouTube users understand the material well.

            "This study aims to investigate the effect of large-scale phenomena, particularly Cross Equatorial Northerly Surge (CENS) and Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation (MJO), on the diurnal cycle of local convection, moisture convergence, and rainfall over the land, coast, and sea in the western part of Java Island. The data used in this study were the CENS and MJO indices, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CINH), Vertically Integrated Moisture Flux Convergence (VIMFC), and rainfall from atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate (ERA-5) for 18\u00a0years (2001\u20132018). The average diurnal profiles of CAPE, CINH, VIMFC, and rainfall over five different locations (mountain, coastal land, coast, coastal sea, non-coastal sea) were plotted to see their patterns under five different large-scale conditions: CENS, Active MJO (AMJO), CENS + Active MJO (CAMJO), CENS + Inactive MJO (CIMJO), and the mean condition. The results showed a distinctive and regular character of diurnal profiles of CAPE, CINH, VIMFC, and rainfall in the five locations caused by the specific responses of different underlying surface properties to the diurnal cycle of incoming solar radiation. Furthermore, CENS tended to reduce CAPE (~ 33% reduction, averaged over all locations), which might suppress free (natural) convection. CENS also tended to reduce CINH (~ 41%), which might facilitate convection. Conversely, CENS tended to increase VIMFC significantly (~ 174%), probably through its interaction with the land breezes, which could induce forced convection. As a result, rainfall significantly increased (~ 63%) during CENS. AMJO showed similar effects to CENS but with much weaker influences. On average, AMJO reduced CAPE (~ 14%), slightly reduced CINH (~ 2%), increased VIMFC (~ 28%), and slightly reduced rainfall (~ 3%). However, the effects were the strongest when CENS and AMJO coincided (CAMJO), during which CAPE reduced (~ 37%), CINH reduced (~ 31%), VIMFC increased (~ 334%), and rainfall increased (~ 123%). The effect of CENS and AMJO was strongest over the coastal area, where rainfall increased by ~ 215%. Therefore, one of the most important results from this study was that the increase in rainfall during CENS and AMJO was not caused primarily by the increase of free convection (indicated by the CAPE), which tended to decrease. The increase of rainfall during CENS and AMJO was found mainly due to the increase of moisture convergence (indicated by the VIMFC), which might induce forced convection. We also found that a relatively high value of CINH tended to coincide with a lower value of rainfall, indicating a possible role of CINH in preventing convection. The results of the analysis of the effects of CENS and MJO on the diurnal cycle of CAPE, CINH, and VIMFC have given a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms that produce rainfall increase, which have not been much discussed in previous studies. During CENS\/MJO, CAPE decreased, so its role was reducing free convection. CINH also generally decreased, so its role was increasing the potential for convective initiation. VIMFC tended to increase significantly, especially around the coast, so its role was increasing the potential for convection. The role of VIMFC tended to be dominant in increasing rainfall. Conversely, the role of CAPE was less important since it was reduced. The effects of MJO were similar to but weaker than CENS in reducing CAPE, reducing CINH, and increasing VIMFC. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",

            "Purpose: Family businesses have contributed significantly to economic growth in various countries, including Indonesia. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reduced the world economy and caused economic shocks in various business sectors. Women successors face significant challenges in overcoming family business problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in terms of resilience, which is seen as the organization's prominent ability for sustainability in a turbulent environment. Thus, this study aims to explore women's initiatives and propose a framework for family business resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study uses a qualitative method with a case study approach to explore women's initiatives in family business resilience during the COVID-19 period. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with five women's successors of family businesses in Indonesia. Triangulation was used to test data validity. Meanwhile, data analysis uses the Miles\u2013Huberman technique: data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing\/verification. Findings: This study found that women have the initiative to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic to develop and implement resilience in the family business. This study proposes a framework for factors that enhance family business resilience, including strategic decision-making (adaptive capacity, strategy renewal and appropriation capacity), strategic factors (successor motivation, successor competence and family support) and successor incremental program. Women have a long-term orientation toward the sustainability of their family businesses and can overcome various conflicts. The stereotypical view of women's leadership in family businesses has experienced a shift in which capability and competence are the main factors in recognizing women's leadership. Originality\/value: This study contributes to understanding women's roles in the resilience of family businesses under extreme stress during the pandemic. This study proposes a framework for family business resilience. In addition, this study adds new insights into the specific context of managing family business systems during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the resource-based view (RBV) and strategic management approach. \u00a9 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

The disturbance is caused by a decrease in the sensory system that focuses the view. This impact will result in the risk of developing fractures and even death if it cannot be treated quickly. Previous research has conducted tests on Human Activity Recognition. In this study, we will test the selection of feature extraction and machine learning methods regarding Human Activity Recognition. The extraction features tested in this study are the mean, median, maximum, minimum, skewness, kurtosis, and variance with Fast Fourier Transform from each value obtained by the IMU sensor. The machine learning methods studied were Stochastic Gradient Descent, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. The test results demonstrate that Y-Axis Gyroscope means, X-Axis Acceleration skewness, X-Axis Gyroscope variance, and X-Axis Gyroscope max are the optimum extraction features for machine learning. The most accurate machine learning algorithm is Random Forest, which has a 99.59% accuracy rate.

In order to create effective educational methods as institutions prepare for the post-pandemic period, it is essential to understand students' preferences for various learning modes. With the aid of machine learning techniques, this study seeks to forecast preferences for learning styles in post-pandemic higher education. The study made use of a dataset compiled from a wide range of college students, which included information on the institution type (public or private), program type (bachelor's or diploma), academic discipline (science or humanities), gender, year of study, internet use, communication costs, comorbidity status, vaccination history, gadget and laptop ownership, and preferred learning mode (online, in-person, or both). For the aim of prediction, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used. Its kernel functions included linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. Performance criteria like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to assess the models after the dataset was randomly partitioned into training and testing sets. The findings showed that for identifying the preferred mode of learning, SVM with the RBF kernel had the highest prediction accuracy (91.67%). Further proving the RBF kernel's efficacy, the confusion matrix analysis showed that high values in the diagonal represented accurate predictions for each of the three classes (both online and onsite). The results imply that machine learning approaches, in particular SVM with the RBF kernel, may accurately forecast students' preferences for learning modes in the post-pandemic situation.

In this context, the use of object detection sensors that facilitate communication between drivers in blind spots has gained traction. This study addresses the pressing concern of road accidents in Indonesia, where statistics reveal a rising trend. By employing fuzzy logic with the Sugeno method, this research proposes a blind spot object detection system for trucks. The system integrates five ultrasonic sensors strategically positioned at the front, left, right, and rear sides of the truck, coupled with fuzzy logic algorithms to process the sensor data. Visual and auditory warning signals, such as buzzers and LEDs, are utilized to alert drivers of potential hazards. The device incorporates input values derived from observation results, utilizing the coefficient value of the sensor distance data. The validity test, employing R2 (R Square), reveals a remarkably strong correlation. This conclusion is supported by the author's meticulous observation of distance data from each sensor, performed 30 times, which yielded an average correlation value of 0.99. The proposed system showcases its efficacy in addressing blind spot-related risks and promises improved road safety through intuitive decision-making mechanisms that are easily comprehensible to drivers.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

By employing fuzzy logic with the Sugeno method, this research proposes a blind spot object detection system for trucks. The system integrates five ultrasonic sensors strategically positioned at the front, left, right, and rear sides of the truck, coupled with fuzzy logic algorithms to process the sensor data. Visual and auditory warning signals, such as buzzers and LEDs, are utilized to alert drivers of potential hazards. The device incorporates input values derived from observation results, utilizing the coefficient value of the sensor distance data. The validity test, employing R2 (R Square), reveals a remarkably strong correlation. This conclusion is supported by the author's meticulous observation of distance data from each sensor, performed 30 times, which yielded an average correlation value of 0.99. The proposed system showcases its efficacy in addressing blind spot-related risks and promises improved road safety through intuitive decision-making mechanisms that are easily comprehensible to drivers.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

To address this, we propose an individualized tourism route recommendation system that considers the user's needs and preferences to create suitable travel itineraries for N-Day.

These findings highlight the efficacy and efficiency of our approach in optimizing multi-criteria evaluations and computation time for tourism route recommendations.

The primary purpose of this research is to process text data on Non-Functional Requirements, where the extraction results can be used as a reference for comparing the suitability between Requirement Elicitation and Deployment Diagram with the text pre-processing method. This research has produced two similarity values, namely between Requirement Elicitation with Non-Functional Requirement and Non-Functional Requirement with Deployment Diagram based on the results of text data extraction in d1-d15. The naming of d1 to d15 is an identity for a text document.

Therefore, this research aims to utilize the 2100 MHz frequency band as an additional frequency for the 4G LTE-A network in the dense urban Central Jakarta region.

            "Accurate and computationally efficient prediction of wave run-up is required to mitigate the impacts of inundation and erosion caused by tides, storm surges, and even tsunami waves. The conventional methods for calculating wave run-up involve physical experiments or numerical modeling. Machine learning methods have recently become a part of wave run-up model development due to their robustness in dealing with large and complex data. In this paper, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based machine learning method is introduced for predicting wave run-up on a sloping beach. More than 400 laboratory observations of wave run-up were utilized as training datasets to construct the XGBoost model. The hyperparameter tuning through the grid search approach was performed to obtain an optimized XGBoost model. The performance of the XGBoost method is compared to that of three different machine learning approaches: multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF). The validation evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other machine learning approaches in predicting the wave run-up with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.98675, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.635%, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.03902. Compared to empirical formulas, which are often limited to a fixed range of slopes, the XGBoost model is applicable over a broader range of beach slopes and incident wave amplitudes. \u2022 The optimized XGBoost method is a feasible alternative to existing empirical formulas and classical numerical models for predicting wave run-up. \u2022 Hyperparameter tuning is performed using the grid search method, resulting in a highly accurate machine-learning model. \u2022 Our findings indicate that the XGBoost method is more applicable than empirical formulas and more efficient than numerical models. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

Typical risk assessments, on the other hand, which produce a list of risk scenarios, more often than not, do not result in enough information for mitigations when it comes to resource limitations such as financial, time, or in this case: delays. Multi-attribute risk assessments give a solid foundation to develop systematic quantitative risk measurements that organizations can use for security mitigations. This study proposes a multi-level and multi-attribute risk assessment method that can be used to prepare mitigations in organization-wide or specific sections of a company. This study presents the evaluation process and results from a case study of a container terminal to evaluate delay risks in its dwelling time processes and to prepare requirements on mitigations based on the risk projections. The proposed method in this study mainly operates within the risk evaluation stage in the risk management lifecycle to complement other methods such as FMEA, FTA, and DEMATEL, which mainly operate within the risk identification and risk analysis stages of risk management. The evaluations in this case study address the efficiency of business process risk factors in a container terminal, not the safety-related risk factors. The proposed method takes event logs from information systems as input to evaluate the risk performances by computing the attributes of the event data. The method also offers risk projections to be treated as a reference to plan for mitigations and determine the likelihood of risk factors.

            "The continuously growing population and urban growth rates are responsible for the sharp rise in energy consumption, which leads to increased CO2emissions and demand-supply imbalances. The power sector is switching to alternative energy sources, including renewable energy resources (RES) such as Photovoltaic (PV) and wind power (WP) and battery energy storage systems (BESS), among others, due to an increase in the use of fossil fuels and their shortage. Since the power generation of these resources is uncertain due to climatic fluctuations and the direct integration of these resources into the power grid is very complex due to the issues such as; voltage and frequency regulation, overloading of active transmission lines, and supply-demand disparity, the research on system uncertainties is receiving increasing attention. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the several parameters of uncertainty, approaches for dealing with the uncertainty in battery energy storage (BES)-based RES integrated grid, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Moreover, various analytical and numerical approaches were developed for integrating RES and BESS into the power grid, including probabilistic methods, possibilistic methods, robust optimization-based techniques, and machine learning algorithms. The comparative analysis of these approaches highlights their relative strengths and weaknesses, providing a valuable resource for researchers and utility planners. Additionally, this review paper identifies several issues and challenges associated with the integration of RES and BESS into the power grid, such as power quality, economical effect, battery aging effect, and environmental effect. Furthermore, the paper suggests a few future research directions, including the development of novel models for analyzing uncertainty in power systems, coordination of uncertainty parameters, integration of BESS into RES and grid, power electronics integration, and environmental factor. Overall, this article's novel contributions include a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty parameters, a comparative analysis of uncertainty modeling approaches, an identification of critical issues and challenges, and the suggestion of future research directions to promote a sustainable and reliable power system. This article will aid in defining the requirements and specifications for novel models for analyzing uncertainty in power systems.

In this study, we propose Compressive Sensing (CS) method to be applied to transform domain-based medical image watermarking. Those method are applied to medical image watermarking based on two transform domains, namely Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform (FDCuT) and Discrete Cosine Transform. CS can secure and also reduce the size of the watermark. The technique of inserting a watermark into the host uses the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method by replacing the diagonal matrix on the host with a watermark diagonal matrix.

            "In plantation areas, soil conditions affect the crop's quality. One of the crucial elements in the soil for plant survival is soil water content (SWC). Radar system has advantages that can be implemented for measuring SWC in plantation areas. A radar system operates by utilizing electromagnetic waves to obtain the dielectric characteristics of the soil. However, the presence of tea plants has become an obstacle to the radar wave propagation toward the soil layer. Re ected signal, which is in uenced by the presence of vegetation, makes the estimation of SWC inaccurate. Consequently, the estimation of SWC needs to consider the vegetation's effect. This study uses an FMCW radar system, which operates at a frequency of 24 GHz.

            "In plantation areas, soil conditions affect the crop's quality. One of the crucial elements in the soil for plant survival is soil water content (SWC). Radar system has advantages that can be implemented for measuring SWC in plantation areas. A radar system operates by utilizing electromagnetic waves to obtain the dielectric characteristics of the soil. However, the presence of tea plants has become an obstacle to the radar wave propagation toward the soil layer. Re ected signal, which is in uenced by the presence of vegetation, makes the estimation of SWC inaccurate. Consequently, the estimation of SWC needs to consider the vegetation's effect. This study uses an FMCW radar system, which operates at a frequency of 24 GHz.

However severe arrhythmias can lead to death and birth defects if not detected and treated properly. The early stages of detecting arrhythmias in the fetus can be done using an electrocardiogram (ECG). A normal ECG signal consisting of PQRST waves and an estimated heart rate can be used to diagnose arrhythmias. Manual examination of fetal arrhythmias is often impractical. Therefore, this study proposes a more effective and simple automatic detection system to detect fetal arrhythmias using segmentation of the ECG signal waveform in the form of PQRST waves with the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) method. This study uses 3 hidden layers with output channels of 16, ReLU activation, fully connected layer, flatten layer, dropout 0.5, and sigmoid activation. The dataset used is non-invasive fetal ECG arrhythmia from Physionet with two categories: Normal and arrhythmias. The best results obtained from this study are with the following parameters: AdaMax optimizer with fixed parameters learning rate of 0.001, epoch of 100, and batch size of 64 provide better performance with an accuracy of 96%. Based on the result, the proposed system has the potential to be used as a non-invasive tool for the early detection of arrhythmia in the fetus so that it can assist medical personnel in providing appropriate treatment. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

For Internet of Things technology, the author uses Arduino, which controls sensors and actuators, while Raspberry Pi is used to process data. In addition, the author uses ultrasonic sensors to measure the water level and a water pump to control the water level. So, if the water level exceeds the specified limit, the pump will move the water to another place, in this prototype, using an aquarium. For fuzzy logic, the criteria used are dry, filled, and full.

Typical risk assessments, on the other hand, which produce a list of risk scenarios, more often than not, do not result in enough information for mitigations when it comes to resource limitations such as financial, time, or in this case: delays. Multi-attribute risk assessments give a solid foundation to develop systematic quantitative risk measurements that organizations can use for security mitigations. This study proposes a multi-level and multi-attribute risk assessment method that can be used to prepare mitigations in organization-wide or specific sections of a company. This study presents the evaluation process and results from a case study of a container terminal to evaluate delay risks in its dwelling time processes and to prepare requirements on mitigations based on the risk projections. The proposed method in this study mainly operates within the risk evaluation stage in the risk management lifecycle to complement other methods such as FMEA, FTA, and DEMATEL, which mainly operate within the risk identification and risk analysis stages of risk management. The evaluations in this case study address the efficiency of business process risk factors in a container terminal, not the safety-related risk factors. The proposed method takes event logs from information systems as input to evaluate the risk performances by computing the attributes of the event data. The method also offers risk projections to be treated as a reference to plan for mitigations and determine the likelihood of risk factors. The evaluation results from this case study have provided insights for operation managers and management to perceive and address risks within TPS Surabaya container terminal's business processes.

Parametric studies are carried out to determine the parameters of guard-trace, including the number of vias and the via diameter. To investigate the effectiveness of guard trace utilization for EM coupling reduction, a two-elements microstrip patch antenna array with a guard trace is designed to work at the frequency of 2.4 GHz. While to verify the design, the prototype of microstrip patch antenna array is realized and characterized. Measurement results indicate a coupling reduction of about 5 dB can be achieved when a 4-vias guard trace with the via diameter of 1 mm is inserted between the antenna patches separated by an edge-to-edge distance of 4 mm.

At worst, dementia is often called a major neurocognitive disorder or senile disease. One of the most common types of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s is vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is closely related to cerebrovascular disease, one of which is stroke. Post-stroke patients with recurrent onset have the potential to develop dementia. An accurate diagnosis is needed for proper therapy management to ensure the patient\u2019s quality of life and prevent it from worsening. The gold standard diagnostic of vascular dementia is complex, includes psychological tests, complete memory tests, and is evidenced by medical imaging of brain lesions. However, brain imaging methods such as CT-Scan, PET-Scan, and MRI have high costs and cannot be routinely used in a short period. For more than two decades, electroencephalogram signal analysis has been an alternative in assisting the diagnosis of brain diseases associated with cognitive decline. Traditional EEG analysis performs visual observations of signals, including rhythm, power, and spikes. Of course, it requires a clinician expert, time consumption, and high costs. Therefore, a quantitative EEG method for identifying vascular dementia in post-stroke patients is discussed in this study. This study used 19 EEG channels recorded from normal elderly, post-stroke with mild cognitive impairment, and post-stroke with dementia. The QEEG method used for feature extraction includes relative power, coherence, and signal complexity; the evaluation performance of normal-mild cognitive impairment-dementia classification was conducted using Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor. The results of the classification simulation showed the highest accuracy of 96% by Gaussian SVM with a sensitivity and specificity of 95.6% and 97.9%, respectively.

            "The current business environment has no room for inefficiency as it can cause companies to lose out to their competitors, to lose customer trust, and to experience cost overruns. Business processes within the company continue to grow and cause them to run more complex. The large scale and complexity of business processes pose a challenge in improving the quality of process model because the effectiveness of time and the efficiency of existing resources are the biggest challenges. In the context of optimizing business processes with a process mining approach, most current process models are optimized with a trace clustering approach to explore the model and to perform analysis on the resulting process model. Meanwhile, in the event log data, not only the activities but also the other resources, such as records of employee or staff working time, process service time, and processing costs, are recorded. This article proposes a mechanism alternative to optimize business processes by exploring the resources that occur in the process. The mechanism is carried out in three stages. The first stage is optimizing the job shop scheduling method from the generated event log. Scheduling the time becomes a problem in the job shop. Utilizing the right time can increase the effectiveness of performance in order to reduce costs. Scheduling can be defined as the allocation of multiple jobs in a series of machines, in which each machine only does one job at a time. In general, scheduling becomes a problem when sequencing the operations and allocating them into specific time slots without prolonging the technical and capacity constraints. The second stage is generating the resource value that is recorded in the event log from the results of analysis of the previous stage, namely, job shop scheduling. The resource values are multivariate and then clustered to determine homogeneous clusters. The last stage is optimizing the nonlinear multipolynomials in the homogeneous cluster formed by using the Hessian solution. The results obtained are analyzed to get recommendations on business processes that are appropriate for the company's needs. The impact of long waiting times will increase service costs, but by improving workload, costs can be reduced. The process model and the value of service costs resulting from the mechanism in the research can be a reference for process owners in evaluating and improving ongoing processes.  \u00a9 2023 Hanung Nindito Prasetyo et al.",

Variations in Total Electron Content (TEC) and Rate of TEC Index (ROTI) within the ionosphere can significantly influence the accuracy and reliability of these signals. This research conducts a comprehensive statistical analysis of TEC variations and ROTI between two strategically located stations: INTU in Bandung City, Indonesia (Lat -6.98N, Lon 107.63E), and GXGN in Guilin City, China (Lat 25.35N, Lon 110.35E). These cities, situated in low-latitude regions, were hypothesized to share a magnetic conjugate relationship. Utilizing data from GNSS Ionospheric Monitor during the equinox season of March 2022, the study found that the GXGN station recorded a higher overall mean TEC value of 45.38 TECU compared to INTU's 28.64 TECU. The study reveals notable anomalies in daily ROTI values, INTU exhibiting irregularities on Day 52 and Day 93, while GXGN showed anomalies on Day 77. These findings warrant further investigation into the potential magnetic conjugate relationship between the two stations. The primary contribution of this paper is to investigate the ionospheric conditions and their implications for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals.

Some characterizations, such as I-V, UV-Vis, XRD, and SEM, have been carried out to study the electrical, crystalline, and optical properties of ZnO\/PVA nanocomposites. The characterization of electrical properties using I-V measurements showed that ZnOsynthesized\/PVA had a high current value of 1.55 nA, while ZnOnano\/PVA had a smaller current value of 1.49 nA when treated at 120 \u00b0C. In addition, the higher the treatment temperature, the greater the resistance of ZnOsynthesized\/PVA and ZnOnano\/PVA. UV-Vis characterization showed that ZnOnano\/PVA experienced a red shift when the temperature increased, while ZnOsynthesized\/PVA and ZnOnano\/PVA when treated at 120 \u00b0C experienced a blue shift. XRD characterization of ZnOnano\/PVA showed that the higher the given temperature, the lower the crystallinity, from 45.77 to 34.81%. SEM characterization showed that ZnOnano\/PVA at room temperature agglomerated and formed larger particles. \u00a9 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved."

However, the implementation of this concept in universities has been limited, with only a few universities adopting it. Telkom University is one of the few universities in Indonesia that has already taken steps to implement ODI at the university level. The adoption of ODI at Telkom University is known as the One Data Telkom University (ODTU) project. This project aims to create a platform for universities to share data and collaborate more effectively. This paper thoroughly examines the implementation of the ODI policy and data warehouse framework at Telkom University, focusing on the ODTU data warehouse design and architecture. This paper discusses the implementation of ODTU into several applications, including the One Data Portal, One Data Dashboard, and One Data Market. Moreover, it identifies the challenges encountered during the implementation process, such as data integration, data privacy and security, standardized data models, and the promotion of a shared vision among stakeholders with varying levels of data literacy. Our analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODTU framework in improving data management practices at Telkom University. The customer satisfaction index (CSI) shows that across key reliability, assurance, and responsiveness measures, Telkom University experienced average score improvements of 3-6% after implementing ODTU.

It manifests in three primary forms: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, specifically, arises from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insufficient insulin production. Remarkably, diabetes ranks as the third leading cause of death in Indonesia, contributing to 6.7% of overall mortality. Timely detection of diabetes plays a pivotal role in mitigating its considerable mortality rate. In light of advancing technology, the integration of machine learning techniques with microarray data has emerged as a promising avenue for early diabetes detection. This study employs the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm in conjunction with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict diabetes based on microarray data. Hyperparameter tuning is applied to three different kernels: RBF, Poly, and Linear, with the aim of enhancing model performance. Our findings reveal that SVM with the RBF kernel yields the most promising outcomes, achieving accuracy and F1-score values of 0.809 and 0.878, respectively, on the test dataset. These results signify a significant step forward in the realm of diabetes prediction, holding potential for early intervention and improved patient outcomes.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Besides, the PPKM must also pay attention to some specific factors related to the real conditions of a region, such as the data on the epidemiology of COVID-19, economic situations, and population mobility. These three are called Multi Factors. Then, based on the data, COVID-19 has a specific spreading period that cannot be repeated and thus is called temporal.

By analyzing temperature, humidity, and raindrops alongside estimated power output, the study achieved a strong relationship (Multiple R of 0.86646562116272 and R-square of 0.750762672656899), demonstrating the tools' effectiveness in optimizing power generation at PLTMH and advancing sustainable energy practices.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

The classical channel models, assuming the effects of atmospheric turbulence in the irradiance distribution, is analyzed both computationally and analytically through closed-form expressions. On the other hands, quantum channel models are analyzed by taking into account the probability of errors caused by turbulence. This paper reveals that the turbulence significantly degrades the capacity of the classical channel compared to the quantum channel; however the degrades in quantum channel is less extreme. Remarkably, none of the quantum channel models experience a drastic drop to zero capacity, where 4 out of 6 models are consistently maintaining non-zero capacity performances.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "In today's fast-paced world, many individuals struggle with managing their emotions, particularly those who are burdened with demanding work schedules. The relentless demands of work can take a toll on both the mind and body, leading to exhaustion and mental strain. When someone reaches their breaking point, emotions can become uncontrollable. To address this issue, this thesis proposes the development of flexible tools specifically designed for use during working hours. These tools leverage the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) method, which effectively detects pulse, sweat gland activity, and body temperature. The accuracy of GSR measurements depends on the individual's physical state during activities, and thus, specialized algorithms are developed for precise data interpretation. By utilizing this tool, individuals gain valuable insights into their stress levels. The tool acts as a facilitator in capturing and analyzing emotional patterns based on pulse, as identified through the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) stage. Examination of GSR measurements collected from data samples reveals distinctive variations in skin response to stress at different times of the day. For instance, during the morning hours, GSR ranges from 481 to 489, while daytime measurements range from 594 to 602. Notably, the GSR range tends to be lower at night, spanning from 392 to 404. These findings emphasize the significance of understanding fluctuations in skin response and the importance of utilizing GSR sensors to accurately measure stress levels.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

The binder was used to bind the mixture of the two carbons, which were stuck together into the current collector. The CMC is a popular binder for supercapacitors due to its high wettability, environmentally friendly, and cheap. However, the CMC is easy to swelling in aqueous electrolytes, which reduces the mechanical properties of the electrode. Here, we propose alternative curing agents to improve the mechanical properties of CMC. The curing agents are epoxy resin, SBR-2 (styrene-butadiene rubber copolymer), and acrylic. For manufacturing the electrodes, the activated carbon, carbon black, CMC, and the curing agents were mixed together and were put on the nickel foam. The produced electrodes were then characterized using the adhesive test, contact angle test, and cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the epoxy resin is the finest curing agent of the CMC-based binder, with adhesive strength of 99.19%. However, the specific capacitance of the electrode with CMC-epoxy resin was lower (37.3 F\/g) than the pristine CMC (54.69 F\/g). This is caused by the highest contact angle of 33.0\u00b10.13\u00b0which indicated the low wettability.

            "This study investigates the level of student satisfaction with hybrid learning in higher education institutions. Hybrid learning, which combines face-to-face and online learning, is gaining popularity due to advances in technology. In this study, six variables were studied: digital literacy, academic mindset, cognitive engagement, time management, attributes, and interactive features. In addition, these variables are evaluated based on the level of student satisfaction. Using a Likert scale questionnaire, data were collected from 40 students at a private university in West Java, Indonesia. To find out the average score of each variable, a descriptive analysis was performed. According to the descriptive analysis, students have good digital literacy and a positive academic outlook. Cognitive engagement, on the other hand, is rated low and requires more learning. There is room for improvement in the quality of learning attributes and learning interactivity. Interestingly, students demonstrated their ability to manage time well. These findings indicate that, although student satisfaction with hybrid learning is still neutral, institutions can improve elements that can affect student satisfaction. Universities must concentrate on improving the interactive aspects of learning and the quality of learning attributes if they want to improve students' learning experiences. These findings will help refine the hybrid learning approach, which will increase student satisfaction and improve learning effectiveness in the future. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "The quality of a test case primarily depends on the software requirements. However, manually identifying crucial elements like preconditions and post-conditions within software requirements can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. This challenge has prompted a research study to propose a novel approach for test case generation using text classification. The proposed approach involves categorizing software requirements into two labels: 'none' and 'both.' These labels indicate the presence or absence of preconditions and post-conditions in software requirements. To achieve this, the research employs the Naive Bayes algorithm, a widely used probabilistic classification algorithm in text classification tasks. The algorithm leverages two libraries, namely Scikit-learn and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The Scikit-learn model proves quite effective through experimentation, achieving an impressive accuracy score of 0.86. This result demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the effort and time required for classifying test case components based on software requirements. By automating this process, the proposed approach offers a promising route for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of test case generation in software testing. By leveraging text classification and machine learning techniques, the proposed approach not only streamlines the identification of essential components in software requirements but also opens up possibilities for further automation and optimization of the testing process.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

            "When rotating a ball using a hand [Figs. 1(a) and (b)], the fingers that touch the ball's outer surface will exert frictional forces on the ball. These frictional forces cause torques on the ball so that the ball spins in the same direction as the finger's rotational direction. If the finger rotates clockwise, the ball's rotational direction will also be clockwise and vice versa. When the ball is cut into half, it is rotated similarly to when spinning a full ball. Thus, we can easily guess that its direction of rotation will be the same as when circling a full ball. What if the ball is spun differently? The half ball is spun using one fingertip from the bottom center of the inside, as shown in Figs. 1(c) and (d). What is the direction of rotation of the half ball? Would it be the same as when the ball is rotated from the outside? It turns out that the spin direction of the half ball is the opposite of the finger's spin direction. The same result was observed when using a pen or a stick to rotate the half ball from the center base [Fig. 1(d) and supplemental video. Finally, suppose we shift the finger's tip to any location so that it will no longer be at the center of the bottom of the object. In that case, the half ball's rotation direction is similar to the one of the finger or stick. Why does this happen? In this paper, the answer to this question is presented.  \u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

This study aims to enhance spell checker performance through the implementation of various text preprocessing techniques, including case folding, tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning model, was employed in this research to facilitate the overall process. The study utilized data gathered from social media communities, comprising a total of 10,000 entries. This data was divided into two subsets; 80% (8,000 entries) was allocated for training and the remaining 20% (2,000 entries) was designated for testing. A series of tests were conducted on datasets subject to different preprocessing approaches: without case folding, without stop words removal, without stemming, and with all text preprocessing stages implemented. The evaluation metrics employed in this study included accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1 score. The results demonstrated notable improvements in spell checker performance with appropriate text preprocessing. Specifically, the accuracy reached 0.86 for the dataset without stemming, 0.74 for the dataset without stop words removal, 0.7 for the dataset without case folding, and 0.89 for the dataset where all preprocessing stages were applied.

Data was collected from 70 students who actively used this application through the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. The initial evaluation results obtained a value of 54 with a score of F with an acceptance range of 'not acceptable. However, with the application of the heuristic evaluation method, a prototype was successfully developed, which showed a significant increase in three main aspects of usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Time completion was reduced by 86%, the error rate decreased by more than 90%, and the completion rate reached 100%. Testing the satisfaction aspect on the prototype using SUS showed a value of 61 with a score of D, with 'acceptable' acceptance. The insertion has helped enrich the usability evaluation process and identified problems that users might have missed.

            "Background The packaging colour conveys a message or information about contents such as predicting the taste\/flavour of unseen contents. Previous studies have a better understanding of consumer attitudes towards food packaging colours. However, few studies approached consumer attitudes from a design or art and humanities perspective. Using colour on package design allows small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to set a higher retail price and to create a premium look that is proper as a souvenir. This study uses a qualitative approach to discover the extent to which the perception of (un)common colours in packaging vary across two different consumer types. Methods One-on-one interviews were conducted to explore personal opinions. The purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used since this study focuses on tourists purchasing food souvenir products. This study involved small samples of 32 individuals (16 local tourists and 16 international travellers). During the interview, three sets of souvenir food packaging were shown to participants as stimuli. Data was coded with descriptive coding (open coding). Coding began by categorising the data using descriptive labels. The second analysis phase was the interpretive phase by axial coding. Results Both local and international groups perceived common and uncommon colours on packaging can create four functional values: brand searching and identification, colour strategy in branding, consumer attention, and brand positioning and competitive advantage. However, participants evaluated common and uncommon colours differently for emotional value creation. When more uncommon colours for both product categories and variants are used, additional perceptions may emerge. Additionally, the more common (congruent) colour, the more representative and informative the packaging design, which highlights the functional value. However, the uncommon colours give more emotional engagement. Conclusions There were differences in the functional value perception across two groups when common colour was applied to packaging. However, there was slight difference between two groups in the emotional value perception when applying the uncommon colour for packaging. Even though this study focuses on SME food souvenir packaging, the findings may have implications for other products' packaging displayed on the shelves. This research contributes to scholarly knowledge by bringing attention to the differences between diverse types of consumers. Limited to a qualitative approach, this study lacks generalisation toward the population and needs to identify a sizeable number of participants and nationalities. \u00a9 This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License",

Therefore, we proposed implementation of crc-16 for error detection in indoor VLC based on IEEE standard 802.15.7. The simulation analysis focuses in physical and MAC layer. The test parameters that used in this research are signal to noise ratio (SNR), signal to interference plus noise and ratio (SINR), bit error rate (BER), and delay. Simulation results show that the VLC system is still vulnerable to interference and jamming attacks that detected by CRC-16. This is indicated by number of received CRC which not equal to 0. In addition, SINR value obtained at 6.32 dB compared to the SNR value of 15.50 dB, it can be seen that there is a decrease in system performance. For the jamming attack simulation, we used various of jamming probabilities.

            "Indonesia is an agrarian country where most of the population is engaged in agriculture. One of the biggest commodities in Indonesian agriculture is the cayenne pepper. Cayenne pepper is a commodity with the highest level of production and demand every year. However, cayenne pepper is a plant that is prone to crop failure. The biggest causes are climate change and lack of knowledge about the parameters that mostly affect the growth of cayenne pepper plants. Therefore, this study aims to help horticulture enthusiasts plant and grow cayenne pepper plants using Smart Greenbox. The Smart Greenbox measures several parameters that affect the growth of a plant, including temperature, humidity, light intensity inside the box, and moisture with the pH level of the soil. All the data measurements will be sent to the IoT cloud so other Smart Greenbox can learn from each other. To help the learning process, a website and growth prediction model using machine learning will be a delivered solution to obtain the most dominant parameters to give optimal growth. The historical data measurement is also stored and displayed on the website to provide feedback for the user to monitor the plant's growth. The overall system test result reports that the device can run optimally 24\/7 for 45 days while sending data to Google Firebase every 5 minutes.

However, the large amount of data collected often contain noise, such as irrelevance post that affect system inaccuracy. One that may affect system inaccuracy is the abundance of headlines text. Headlines text is a part of the text that describes the text below it. Therefore, this study designed an effective method to collect text headlines and non-headline texts, as well as building a model to detect text headlines. The data collection method developed had low error rates, making it a good reference for obtaining text headlines and non-headline text. The model built to detect text headlines had good performance with the highest accuracy is achieved by the IndoBERTweet model at 0.9921. The CNN and fastText models built had lower accuracy of 0.9081 and 0.8793 respectively, but were 200-2000x faster than IndoBERTweet. Moreover, our findings revealed that more than half of the total data in the four COVID-19 related topics comprised text headlines.

            "Social media post such as tweet in Twitter is one of main source of text analysis. However, the large amount of data collected often contain noise, such as irrelevance post that affect system inaccuracy. One that may affect system inaccuracy is the abundance of headlines text. Headlines text is a part of the text that describes the text below it. Therefore, this study designed an effective method to collect text headlines and non-headline texts, as well as building a model to detect text headlines. The data collection method developed had low error rates, making it a good reference for obtaining text headlines and non-headline text. The model built to detect text headlines had good performance with the highest accuracy is achieved by the IndoBERTweet model at 0.9921. The CNN and fastText models built had lower accuracy of 0.9081 and 0.8793 respectively, but were 200-2000x faster than IndoBERTweet. Moreover, our findings revealed that more than half of the total data in the four COVID-19 related topics comprised text headlines. Furthermore, the observed errors in the studied models can be attributed to the complex intrinsic properties of a headline text, fastText limitations in representing non-standardized words, and the training data used to build the fastText model.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Recently, it has become a common practice to use an online recipe to select the ingredients that match an individual\u2019s meal plan and healthy diet preference. The information from online recipes can be extracted and used to develop various food-related applications. Named entity recognition (NER) is often used to extract such information. However, the problem in building an NER system lies in the massive amount of data needed to train the classifier, especially on a specific domain, such as food. There are food NER datasets available, but they are still quite limited. Thus, we proposed an iterative self-training approach called semi-supervised multi-model prediction technique (SMPT) to construct a food ingredient NER dataset. SMPT is a deep ensemble learning model that employs the concept of self-training and uses multiple pre-trained language models in the iterative data labeling process, with a voting mechanism used as the final decision to determine the entity\u2019s label. Utilizing the SMPT, we have created a new annotated dataset of ingredient entities obtained from the Allrecipes website named FINER.

The bidirectional encoder representation transformer (BERT) is also one of the other pre-Trained transformer models. However, there are research opportunities to use BERT in sentiment analysis for the Rotten Tomatoes review. Our research aims to use BERT for sentiment analysis on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset and evaluate the results. Our research step is to get the Rotten Tomatoes dataset from the Huggingface dataset. We do pre-processing for the BERT model, tune the BERT model, then train the model using the dataset. We use the lightweight pre-Trained DistilBERT as part of our proposed model. We compare the performance of our BERT model with three state-of-The-Art benchmark methods: support vector machine with term frequency-inverse document frequency (SVM+TF-IDF), na\u00efve Bayes with TF-IDF (NB+TF-IDF), and convolutional neural network (CNN). We use several test metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating curve (ROC). In the training optimization process, we learned that AdamW is more effective than Adam optimizer. Our test results show that BERT's performance is better than the other three models with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Scores of 0.753, 0.754, 0.754, and 0.753, respectively. Finally, BERT is also the best in terms of AUC, with a value of 0.826.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

The purpose of this study is to predict the presence of these circulations and the impact of these circulations on the distribution of rain throughout Indonesia. The territory of Indonesia was divided into 14 clusters to determine the effect of CENS and MJO and observe the relation of which with extreme rainfall patterns in each area. The method used to predict these three phenomena is a statistical approach called vector autoregressive (VAR), which indicates the occurrence of global circulation and extreme rain in Indonesia. In the studied area, there is a cointegration or long-term relationship between variables, which can be anticipated using the vector error correction model (VECM). It is also found that the presence of CENS and MJO circulation can be predicted with the model error rate measured based on the MAPE values of 1.8518 and 0.0619. When CENS is active (inactive), rainfall occurrences occur more (less) in the southern part of Indonesia, respectively.

Surface anomalies on railroad tracks can lead to increased speeds, resulting in elevated noise levels and a higher risk of train accidents. To enhance quality standards, manual inspections by field workers are necessary. However, these inspections require significant manpower, suffer from accuracy issues, and incur substantial costs. To streamline the inspection process, we analyzed a deep learning-based surface flaw detection system that employed three variations of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm: YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8. The aim was to improve the efficiency of the sorting stage. Furthermore, our experiments focused on converting pixel labels into rectangular or bounding box labels using the RSDDs dataset, which comprises two primary categories: highspeed rail (type 1) and heavy rail (type 2). Given the challenging nature of this dataset, the defect detection system achieved accuracies of 92.7% for YOLOv6-L6, 95.6% for YOLOv7-D6, and 99.5% for YOLOv8-S within the type 1 category. In the type 2 category, the results were 88.03% for YOLOv6-S6, 88.5% for YOLOv7W6, and 91.3% for YOLOv8M.

To address this issue, a needle testing device should be developed to determine the acoustic properties of spinal needles. The device should be capable of accurately and precisely positioning the needle according to the instructed coordinates. In addition, it is important to have visual feedback for the device to ensure proper needle placement. To provide this, a camera will be placed in front of the device to provide real-Time visualization of the needle as it is moved. The camera will read the location or coordinates of the spinal needle, providing feedback for the device. This visual feedback allows the user to monitor the needle's position and make any necessary adjustments for proper placement. To accomplish this, a needle detection system needs to be created as a subsystem for the device using deep learning and object detection techniques with the YOLOv8 model.

The research reveals a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.76 for positive sentiment and 0.7 for negative sentiment, as determined through the Spearman Rank correlation test. Additionally, the expansion of the GloVe feature improves the accuracy of the GRU classification model when combined with TF-IDF feature extraction. However, implementing the Globe feature expansion in the CNN classification model results in a decrease in accuracy by 73.9% compared to using only TF-IDF feature extraction. To address this, a hybrid CNN-GRU model with TF-IDF feature extraction and GloVe expansion is proposed, achieving a significant improvement in accuracy. The hybrid model outperforms the individual baselines, demonstrating an increase in accuracy of +1.88 compared to the best CNN baseline with feature extraction and +1.86 compared to the GRU baseline with GloVe feature and feature extraction. These findings emphasize the importance of considering sentiment analysis and feature expansion techniques in predicting the movement of BBCA shares. However, limitations of the study, such as the limited dataset and exclusive focus on Bank BCA's stock prices, highlight the need for future research to encompass a wider range of businesses and incorporate time-shifting techniques for a more comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, a balanced labeling process and increased data volume are recommended to further enhance the accuracy and applicability of future studies in this domain.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

Even though the company is quite large and operates in the field of research and development of cars, the company only uses Microsoft Excel and WhatsApp in managing its training. That method raises several problems such as the lack of transparency of training data, the possibility that employees forget the training schedule, the possibility that training history is inaccurate, and making training reports takes a long time. Therefore, the company developed a system called the Training Management Information System (TAMIS) to improve the performance of its training management. TRAMIS is a web-based application that can help improve training management by making it easier for employees to view their training plans, training schedules, and training history. In addition, it also makes it easier for training facilitators to see participants who can attend training, makes it easier to do training reminders for potential training participants, makes it easier to see participants who attend training (attendance), and makes it easier to make training achievement reports of employees as needed. The results of this study indicated that the system had been successfully created. In addition, it can be shown that the training management process is more efficient than before, where the total processing time is reduced from 114 hours to only 4.09 hours.

To forecast blood glucose levels 15, 30, and 45 minutes in the future, we suggested deep neural network (DNN) and tested it on 7 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The suggested prediction model was evaluated against a variety of machine learning models, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree (DT), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random forest (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).

With the advancement of digital information, it has become easier for tourists to find information about attractions they want to visit. However, many tourists still rely on information from others to use as a reference in planning their travel schedule for several days. To address this issue, we propose a system that can recommend a personal travel itinerary within a few days of tour visit. We can consider that determining a tourist route is the same as finding the optimal solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Various algorithms can be used to solve TSP, including the Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSO). In our research, we develop a system that can generate optimal recommendations for scheduling tourist routes in Yogyakarta using the CSO algorithm by combining the concept of Multi-Attribute Utility Theory to meet the needs of users based on various criteria such as ratings, cost, and time. Our experiment uses Simulated Annealing (SA) as the base model. The proposed method showed that the CSO algorithm performed better than the SA in optimality and computational efficiency. Specifically, the CSO algorithm produced itineraries that are 1.67% more optimal than SA when considering multi-criteria and faster than SA in computation time when considering single-criteria. These findings suggest that the CSO algorithm is an effective and efficient method for generating optimal tours.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

To address this issue, we propose a system that can recommend a personal travel itinerary within a few days of tour visit. We can consider that determining a tourist route is the same as finding the optimal solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Various algorithms can be used to solve TSP, including the Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSO). In our research, we develop a system that can generate optimal recommendations for scheduling tourist routes in Yogyakarta using the CSO algorithm by combining the concept of Multi-Attribute Utility Theory to meet the needs of users based on various criteria such as ratings, cost, and time. Our experiment uses Simulated Annealing (SA) as the base model. The proposed method showed that the CSO algorithm performed better than the SA in optimality and computational efficiency. Specifically, the CSO algorithm produced itineraries that are 1.67% more optimal than SA when considering multi-criteria and faster than SA in computation time when considering single-criteria. These findings suggest that the CSO algorithm is an effective and efficient method for generating optimal tours.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Traffic flow can specify its condition, whether it is a free flow or very heavy traffic. Traffic condition is the most important criterion used to find the best route from an origin to a destination. This paper collects the traffic condition for several road segments which are calculated based on the degree of saturation by using two methods, namely, (1) by counting the number of vehicles using object detection in the public closed-circuit television (CCTV) stream, and (2) by requesting the traffic information (vehicle\u2019s speed) using TomTom. Both methods deliver the saturation degree and calculate the traffic condition for each road segment. Based on the experiments, the average error rate obtained by counting the number of vehicles on Pramuka\u2013Cihapit and Trunojoyo was 0\u20132 cars, 2\u20133 motorcycles, and 0\u20131 for others. Meanwhile, the average error on Merdeka-Aceh Intersection reached 6 cars, 11 motorcycles, and 1 for other vehicles. The average speed calculation for the left side of the road is more accurate than the right side, and the average speed on the left side is less than 3.3 km\/h. Meanwhile, on the right side, the differences between actual and calculated vehicle speeds are between 11.088 and 22.222 km\/h. This high error rate is caused by (1) the low resolution of the public CCTV, (2) some obstacles interfering with the view of CCTV, (3) the misdetection of the type of vehicles, and by (4) the vehicles moving too fast.

A KG is called incomplete if there is a missing relationship between two entities. An incomplete KG can have an impact on decreasing the accuracy of a task that uses the KG.

In general, WS estimation at different heights requires the site-dependent parameters such as wind shear coefficient, atmospheric conditions, and roughness length. This paper examines the use of the Convolutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BLSTM) to estimate WS at different heights based on measurements at lower heights. To perform vertical extrapolation, the CNN-BLSTM uses measured WS at 10\u201340\u00a0m heights to predict WS at 50\u00a0m. The predicted WS at 50\u00a0m are further used along with the measured WS at 10\u201340 to extrapolate WS at 60\u00a0m. This procedure is repeated until the extrapolation of WS at 180\u00a0m is achieved. The performance of the CNN-BLSTM is compared with the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine for regression (SVM), and the standard wind shear exponent (WSE)-based estimation. The extrapolated values obtained using these methods are compared with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) reference system-based measurements.

            "Analyzing customer shopping habits in physical stores is crucial for enhancing the retailer\u2013customer relationship and increasing business revenue. However, it can be challenging to gather data on customer browsing activities in physical stores as compared to online stores. This study suggests using RFID technology on store shelves and machine learning models to analyze customer browsing activity in retail stores. The study uses RFID tags to track product movement and collects data on customer behavior using receive signal strength (RSS) of the tags. The time-domain features were then extracted from RSS data and machine learning models were utilized to classify different customer shopping activities. We proposed integration of iForest Outlier Detection, ADASYN data balancing and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The results indicate that the proposed model performed better than other supervised learning models, with improvements of up to 97.778% in accuracy, 98.008% in precision, 98.333% in specificity, 98.333% in recall, and 97.750% in the f1-score. Finally, we showcased the integration of this trained model into a web-based application. This result can assist managers in understanding customer preferences and aid in product placement, promotions, and customer recommendations. \u00a9 2023 by the authors.",

Throughout the measurement process, the NodeMCU also records the data and sends it to the monitoring application. The monitoring application is designed by wireless communication and applied on a mobile device.

The findings showed that the predicted yearly effective doses (\u00b5Sv year-1) for232Th,238U and40K were 1.67, 0.70, and 11.92 correspondingly, which were much lower than the UNSCEAR recommendation and considered to be safe.

One of the essential components of NDN is the Content Store (CS), which maximizes caching performance by predicting content popularity using deep learning. This ensures that popular content is stored since numerous users request it. In addition to content popularity prediction, proactive caching is another method that can boost cache efficiency. Proactive caching involves storing content before users request it. This paper will apply the classification of popular content using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with proactive caching to the cache placement strategy. Furthermore, the method will be utilized to determine the impact of cache node locations. Based on simulation results applied to the edge-cache placement strategy, the proposed model achieves a 15% increase in cache hit ratio compared to the reactive edge-cache approach. Additionally, the average round trip time is reduced by 8% to 15%, and the cache miss rate is reduced by 15%. By employing the degree method for cache node placement, the cache hit ratio can be increased by 15% to 25%, and the average Round Trip Time (RTT) can be reduced by 15%. Moreover, the Cache Miss value is reduced by 10%.

This research work proposes a combination of three major renewable energy sources with thermal power sources (solar, wind and hydro). The proposed objective function includes a large number of major constraints related to each of the included sources which have not been combined before. The pattern search algorithm has been implemented on IEEE 40 unit test system combining wind, solar and hydro power generating units to observe the results. The results are also compared with the 140 unit Korean power generation model and in addition to several similar systems. Simulation results show that the problem formulation and inclusion of respective constraints bring authenticity to the system and produce accurate results. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

            "Myocardial Infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, is a type of cardiovascular disease characterized by the death of heart muscle cells. This condition occurs due to the blockage of blood vessels around the heart, inhibiting blood flow and causing an insufficient oxygen supply to the body. Typically, cardiovascular disease tests involve electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. In recent years, researchers have explored the application of Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals for cardiovascular detection due to their non-invasive, efficient, accessible, and cost-effective nature. While deep learning has been successful in object detection in digital images, its application to PCG signals for heart attack detection is rare. This study bridges this gap by introducing an enhanced technique called the Myocardial Infarction Detection System (MIDs). In contrast to previous deep learning research, this study employs a transfer learning algorithm as a classifier for MI feature datasets. Feature extraction is performed in segments to obtain more accurate MI features. Six feature extraction methods and transfer learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using the VGG-16 architecture were selected as the primary components for MI identification. Additionally, this study compares these models with other CNN transfer learning models, such as VGG-19 and Xception, to assess their performance. Two experimental scenarios were conducted to evaluate MIDs performance in MI detection: experiments without hyperparameter tuning and with hyperparameter tuning. The results indicate that MIDs with CNN (VGG-16) after tuning exhibited the highest detection performance compared to other transfer learning CNN models, both with and without tuning. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of MIDS detection with this configuration were 96.7%, 96.0%, and 97.4%, respectively. This research contributes to the development of an enhanced MI detection technique based on PCG signals using a transfer learning CNN.  \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

But the detection process also takes a long time and requires a large amount of money. So, this study proposed a deep learning method using CNN by implementing the MobilenetV2 architecture, which is a lightweight model and mobile-friendly architecture. In this study, we used the primary dataset from the APTOS 2019 dataset, which contains 3662 retinal fundus images. Diabetic retinopathy is divided into 5 classes, starting from No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR. To produce an optimal class classification in this study, first balance the dataset scheme to 800 in each class by using image augmentation and implementing circle cropping. So, the highest results are obtained with this method with the following parameters: batch size of 32, learning rate of 0.001, RMSProp optimizer, and epoch 100. Testing accuracy is 92.6% as a result of this parameter. The macro precision, recall, and f1-score are 92.8%, 92.6%, and 92.4%, respectively. Our results show that augmentation techniques and circle crop methods can make the MobileNetV2 architecture bring good performance results, and several parameters can bring significant system performance results.

The use of Kaiser function in weighting method will give significant sidelobe level (SLL) suppression and offer a flexibility by changing the value of \u03b2 parameters.

            "The quality of a test case primarily depends on the software requirements. However, manually identifying crucial elements like preconditions and post-conditions within software requirements can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. This challenge has prompted a research study to propose a novel approach for test case generation using text classification. The proposed approach involves categorizing software requirements into two labels: 'none' and 'both.' These labels indicate the presence or absence of preconditions and post-conditions in software requirements. To achieve this, the research employs the Naive Bayes algorithm, a widely used probabilistic classification algorithm in text classification tasks. The algorithm leverages two libraries, namely Scikit-learn and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The Scikit-learn model proves quite effective through experimentation, achieving an impressive accuracy score of 0.86. This result demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the effort and time required for classifying test case components based on software requirements. By automating this process, the proposed approach offers a promising route for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of test case generation in software testing. By leveraging text classification and machine learning techniques, the proposed approach not only streamlines the identification of essential components in software requirements but also opens up possibilities for further automation and optimization of the testing process.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

The proposed approach involves categorizing software requirements into two labels: 'none' and 'both.' These labels indicate the presence or absence of preconditions and post-conditions in software requirements. To achieve this, the research employs the Naive Bayes algorithm, a widely used probabilistic classification algorithm in text classification tasks. The algorithm leverages two libraries, namely Scikit-learn and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The Scikit-learn model proves quite effective through experimentation, achieving an impressive accuracy score of 0.86. This result demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the effort and time required for classifying test case components based on software requirements. By automating this process, the proposed approach offers a promising route for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of test case generation in software testing. By leveraging text classification and machine learning techniques, the proposed approach not only streamlines the identification of essential components in software requirements but also opens up possibilities for further automation and optimization of the testing process.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "When rotating a ball using a hand [Figs. 1(a) and (b)], the fingers that touch the ball's outer surface will exert frictional forces on the ball. These frictional forces cause torques on the ball so that the ball spins in the same direction as the finger's rotational direction. If the finger rotates clockwise, the ball's rotational direction will also be clockwise and vice versa. When the ball is cut into half, it is rotated similarly to when spinning a full ball. Thus, we can easily guess that its direction of rotation will be the same as when circling a full ball. What if the ball is spun differently? The half ball is spun using one fingertip from the bottom center of the inside, as shown in Figs. 1(c) and (d). What is the direction of rotation of the half ball? Would it be the same as when the ball is rotated from the outside? It turns out that the spin direction of the half ball is the opposite of the finger's spin direction. The same result was observed when using a pen or a stick to rotate the half ball from the center base [Fig. 1(d) and supplemental video. Finally, suppose we shift the finger's tip to any location so that it will no longer be at the center of the bottom of the object. In that case, the half ball's rotation direction is similar to the one of the finger or stick. Why does this happen? In this paper, the answer to this question is presented.  \u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning model, was employed in this research to facilitate the overall process. The study utilized data gathered from social media communities, comprising a total of 10,000 entries. This data was divided into two subsets; 80% (8,000 entries) was allocated for training and the remaining 20% (2,000 entries) was designated for testing. A series of tests were conducted on datasets subject to different preprocessing approaches: without case folding, without stop words removal, without stemming, and with all text preprocessing stages implemented. The evaluation metrics employed in this study included accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1 score. The results demonstrated notable improvements in spell checker performance with appropriate text preprocessing. Specifically, the accuracy reached 0.86 for the dataset without stemming, 0.74 for the dataset without stop words removal, 0.7 for the dataset without case folding, and 0.89 for the dataset where all preprocessing stages were applied.

However, the context-sensitive nature of tweets can pose challenges to understanding message content, particularly in languages like Indonesian with potential for significant vocabulary discrepancies. This study aims to enhance cyberbullying detection by employing feature expansion using FastText, thereby addressing vocabulary-related comprehension issues in Indonesian-language tweets. Furthermore, text classification is performed using a Hybrid Deep Learning approach, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). This hybrid model leverages the strengths of both techniques, capturing local patterns and long-range dependencies within the data.

Therefore, this study classifies Sundanese script using the deep learning method, namely the Transfer Learning method based on the Convolutional Neural Network. The architectures used in this research are ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNet. Then to evaluate the performance of the three architectures, the evaluation metrics used in this study are Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-scores will be used. The three CNN architectures show very satisfactory results in classifying Sundanese scripts. VGG-19 architecture Accuracy is 99% for training data and 95% for validation data, the ResNet-50 architecture is 97%, and for validation data is 91%. Meanwhile, the MobileNet architecture data train produces an Accuracy of 97% and data validation of 92%. Overall.

Stockholders must analyze the stocks they intend to purchase. Stockholders often analyze stocks by observing patterns that occurred in the previous days to predict future prices. Therefore, a method is needed to simplify the process of analyzing the stock pattern. Although there are already several websites that have the concept of predicting stock prices, these websites do not utilize deep learning algorithms. This research aims to develop a stock price prediction website using deep learning algorithms, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to help users predict stock prices.

However, proving that good performance of smart lighting control can increase user comfort is still a research opportunity. On the other hand, existing research mentioned that user comfort metrics in smart lighting are still limited. The aim of our study is a proposed novel technology acceptance model (TAM) called smart lighting TAM (SLTAM), which can measure user comfort and smart lighting technology acceptance. We formed SLTAM by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The first step of our research was to develop a basic TAM construct containing user comfort and then run a survey. The next step is to carry out EFA, which involves several tests, such as Bartlett's test of sphericity, Scree plot analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The test results show that, through Scree plot analysis, four latent factors exist in our TAM model. We named these latent factors: comfort, perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived efficiency (PE), and behavioral intention (BI). Through structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, our measurements show that comfort correlates with PE with a significance value of <0.01. PE correlates with PEOU and BI with a significance value of <0.01. Finally, PEOU correlates with BI with a significance value of 0.03. Through this methodology, we conclude that SLTAM is a valid model to measure comfort and the acceptance of smart lighting technology. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

We perform a series of computer simulations to evaluate the dominance of either Rayleigh fading or Doppler effects on the error-floor of the 5G&B high-speed railway system. The results show that the domination of Rayleigh fading and the Doppler effects depends on the number of antenna elements. When the number of antenna elements is large, Rayleigh fading dominates; however, when the number of antenna elements is small, the Doppler effect dominates causing worse bit-error-rate (BER) performances.

            "The COVID-19 virus has rapidly spread throughout the world, and the WHO declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Previous research considered five domains associated with the social vulnerability index in the context of pandemic infection management and mitigation in the community, such as socioeconomic conditions, demographic composition, housing and hygiene, availability of health care facilities, and epidemiological factors related to COVID-19. The Katadata Insight Center (KIC) investigates the vulnerability index of Indonesian provinces to the coronavirus based on the risks of regional characteristics, population health, and mobility. There is a chance that the supporting data is either incomplete or missing, which is a common flaw that influences the prediction system\u2019s results and renders it ineffective. This paper will compare the kNN-based imputation method with the mean imputation to handle missing data, which causes the provincial vulnerability index in Indonesia to be measured incorrectly. The vulnerability index associated with COVID-19 should be one of the factors considered by the Indonesian government when making decisions or establishing a lockdown strategy and large-scale restriction rules in each province. When missing data is discovered, kNN imputation and mean imputation can be used as a solution. Based on the results of the experiments, the mean imputation has a much lower average RMSE performance than the kNN imputation method in the dataset of vulnerability index in dealing with COVID-19 in Indonesia. \u00a9 2023 Copyright held by the owner\/author(s).",

            "The COVID-19 virus has rapidly spread throughout the world, and the WHO declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Previous research considered five domains associated with the social vulnerability index in the context of pandemic infection management and mitigation in the community, such as socioeconomic conditions, demographic composition, housing and hygiene, availability of health care facilities, and epidemiological factors related to COVID-19. The Katadata Insight Center (KIC) investigates the vulnerability index of Indonesian provinces to the coronavirus based on the risks of regional characteristics, population health, and mobility. There is a chance that the supporting data is either incomplete or missing, which is a common flaw that influences the prediction system\u2019s results and renders it ineffective. This paper will compare the kNN-based imputation method with the mean imputation to handle missing data, which causes the provincial vulnerability index in Indonesia to be measured incorrectly. The vulnerability index associated with COVID-19 should be one of the factors considered by the Indonesian government when making decisions or establishing a lockdown strategy and large-scale restriction rules in each province. When missing data is discovered, kNN imputation and mean imputation can be used as a solution. Based on the results of the experiments, the mean imputation has a much lower average RMSE performance than the kNN imputation method in the dataset of vulnerability index in dealing with COVID-19 in Indonesia. \u00a9 2023 Copyright held by the owner\/author(s)."

Those companies generally provide or facilitate various kinds of training programs that their workers must follow. However, unfortunately, there are still companies that do not manage the training process well. For example, the company that became the case study for this study still uses manual methods in managing its training activities. Even though the company is quite large and operates in the field of research and development of cars, the company only uses Microsoft Excel and WhatsApp in managing its training. That method raises several problems such as the lack of transparency of training data, the possibility that employees forget the training schedule, the possibility that training history is inaccurate, and making training reports takes a long time. Therefore, the company developed a system called the Training Management Information System (TAMIS) to improve the performance of its training management. TRAMIS is a web-based application that can help improve training management by making it easier for employees to view their training plans, training schedules, and training history. In addition, it also makes it easier for training facilitators to see participants who can attend training, makes it easier to do training reminders for potential training participants, makes it easier to see participants who attend training (attendance), and makes it easier to make training achievement reports of employees as needed. The results of this study indicated that the system had been successfully created. In addition, it can be shown that the training management process is more efficient than before, where the total processing time is reduced from 114 hours to only 4.09 hours. The results of this research can be a consideration for researchers or practitioners who will develop similar systems in the future. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "The unique chemical properties of drugs enable them to interact with specific proteins, effectively treating or preventing diseases by disrupting various molecular processes. However, the accurate prediction of drug side effects is of paramount importance due to the associated risks involved. In this regard, machine learning algorithms offer promising avenues for early-stage identification of potential side effects, with in-silico approaches proving valuable for drug prediction. A notable in-silico method is SMILES2Vec, which utilizes word embedding techniques to encode a compound's molecular structure and generate vector representations of molecules. To evaluate its performance, this study employed a dataset from the SIDER (Side Effect Resource), specifically focusing on Hepatobiliary disorder side effects. The investigation involved assessing different layer combinations and optimizers within the SMILES2Vec model. In particular, the study explored the impact of introducing a convolution layer before the GRU layer and a dense layer after it, aiming to enhance the model's performance. The results revealed that a model consisting of l-layer convolution, 2-layer GRU, and 1-layer dense achieved the highest accuracy and F1-Score, reaching 64.39% and 67.39%, respectively. Furthermore, the Adagrad optimizer played a significant role by dynamically adjusting the learning rate for each parameter. This optimization technique not only improved the F1-Score to 68.62%, but also effectively prevented overfitting during the model training process. The evaluation of SMILES2Vec model's layer combinations and optimizers provided valuable insights for predicting drug side effects. Selecting appropriate architectural components and optimization techniques is crucial to enhance accuracy, benefiting patient care and well-being.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "Cancer is a non-contagious disease that is the leading cause of death globally. The most common types of cancer with high mortality are lung and colon cancer. One of the efforts to reduce cases of death is early diagnosis followed by medical therapy. Tissue sampling and clinical pathological examination are the gold standard in cancer diagnosis. However, in some cases, pathological examination of tissue to the cell level requires high accuracy, depending on the contrast of the pathological image, and the experience of the clinician. Therefore, we need an image processing approach combined with artificial intelligence for automatic classification. In this study, a method is proposed for automatic classification of lung and colon cancer based on a deep learning approach. The object of the image that is classified is the histopathological image of normal tissue, benign cancer, and malignant cancer. Convolutional neural network (CNN) with VGG16 architecture and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) were employed for demonstration of classification on 25000 histopathological images. The simulation results show that the proposed method is able to classify with a maximum accuracy of 98.96%. The system performance using CLAHE shows a higher detection accuracy than without using CLAHE and is consistent for all epoch scenarios. The comparative study shows that the proposed method outperforms some previous studies. With this proposed method, it is hoped that it can help clinicians in diagnosing cancer automatically, with low cost, high accuracy, and fast processing on large datasets. \u00a9 The Author(s).

            "Cancer is a non-contagious disease that is the leading cause of death globally. The most common types of cancer with high mortality are lung and colon cancer. One of the efforts to reduce cases of death is early diagnosis followed by medical therapy. Tissue sampling and clinical pathological examination are the gold standard in cancer diagnosis. However, in some cases, pathological examination of tissue to the cell level requires high accuracy, depending on the contrast of the pathological image, and the experience of the clinician. Therefore, we need an image processing approach combined with artificial intelligence for automatic classification.

Among several well-known communication protocols, the MQTT is considered as the most lightweight communication protocol for IoT devices. In addition, the MQTT communication protocol can also provide privacy protection due to the existence of the broker connecting publishers and subscribers in an anonymized way without exposing their addresses. However, this anonymity property can lead to Sybil attacks, including message falsification, replay attack, and impersonation attacks to the IoT systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a SibProMQTT scheme that can make the MQTT communication protocol resist against those issues. The SibProMQTT works by using a timestamp and unique session key on each data transmission and eventually encrypting the MQTT payload for avoiding data theft. The experimental results show that our proposed scheme only induces small computational cost addition which is insignificant for the IoT devices. Moreover, security analyses demonstrate that the SibProMQTT can effectively protect the MQTT communication against Sybil attacks as long as the private key cannot be obtained by attackers. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "Segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiography is an important task for the quantification of volume and mass in heart disease. Continuing advances in echocardiography have extended imaging capabilities into the 3D domain, subsequently overcoming the geometric assumptions associated with conventional 2D acquisitions. Nevertheless, the analysis of 3D echocardiography (3DE) poses several challenges associated with limited spatial resolution, poor contrast-to-noise ratio, complex noise characteristics, and image anisotropy. To develop automated methods for 3DE analysis, a sufficiently large, labeled dataset is typically required. However, ground truth segmentations have historically been difficult to obtain due to the high inter-observer variability associated with manual analysis. We address this lack of expert consensus by registering labels derived from higher-resolution subject-specific cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, producing 536 annotated 3DE images from 143 human subjects (10 of which were excluded). This heterogeneous population consists of healthy controls and patients with cardiac disease, across a range of demographics. To demonstrate the utility of such a dataset, a state-of-the-art, self-configuring deep learning network for semantic segmentation was employed for automated 3DE analysis. Using the proposed dataset for training, the network produced measurement biases of \u22129 \u00b1 16 ml, \u22121 \u00b1 10 ml, \u22122 \u00b1 5 %, and 5 \u00b1 23 g, for end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, and mass, respectively, outperforming an expert human observer in terms of accuracy as well as scan-rescan reproducibility. As part of the Cardiac Atlas Project, we present here a large, publicly available 3DE dataset with ground truth labels that leverage the higher resolution and contrast of CMR, to provide a new benchmark for automated 3DE analysis. Such an approach not only reduces the effect of observer-specific bias present in manual 3DE annotations, but also enables the development of analysis techniques which exhibit better agreement with CMR compared to conventional methods. This represents an important step for enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic and prognostic information to be obtained from echocardiography.

The aim of this study is to dissect and analyze a collection of 775 negative and 557 positive comment reviews, drawn from four distinct e-commerce platforms. By classifying these remarks into positive and negative sentiments, this research endeavors to illuminate underlying trends permeating these marketplaces. The research methodology employed involves field observations of online shopping experiences, utilizing data derived from 254 e-commerce customers. These data were collected via validated questionnaires and subsequently analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach, employing the lavaan r library within the R programming environment. The questionnaire results produced a rating scale from 1 to 5, categorizing responses from 'very satisfied' to 'less satisfied', effectively illustrating both positive and negative commentary. The field comment data collected was coordinated with comment data extracted from four marketplace trading accounts. This data comment customer was analyzed using a range of comparative models such as k-nearest neighbors, multinomial naive bayes, stochastic gradient descent, and decision trees to conduct sentiment analysis. The findings reveal that the naive bayes method generates the greatest accuracy in sentiment analysis, registering an accuracy value of 0.886. Moreover, the analysis executed through r programming indicates that the e-service quality model yields the most robust results, reflected by an adjusted r-square value of 0.885.

However, there is a research opportunity to provide a learning model that requires less training data. Our research aim is to use PCA-SVM for lightweight hand gesture recognition. The first step of our research is to collect the MNIST Gesture dataset from Kaggle. Then, we do preprocessing and prediction model training.

The test results show that the optimum number of PCA-SVM principal components in ASL hand gesture recognition is 50. Then, PCA performs better than MDI and LASSO on dimension reduction with an SVM model. Finally, the PCA-SVM model bests LSTM in hand gesture recognition by accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

There are various ways to classify characteristics for gait of each individual, one of them is the inertia sensor. The inertia sensor is used to collect data gait signals, which are angular velocity variations caused by human walking movements. Multidistance Signal Level Difference Sample Entropy is proposed in this study as a feature extraction before classifying individual gaits. MSLD is used to measure the co-occurrence of two signal samples at a distance d, and SampEn quantizes signal complexity. The MSLD Entropy produce 60 features in the form of SampEn at distances of 1 until 20 from the threeaxis. The testing procedure is carried out on the MSLD Entropy result signal for each classifier with a feature in the form of SampEn at distances of d=1-20, d=1-15, d=1-10, and d=1-5. Softmax regression as a classifier and feature at distance 1 until 20, the test results produce the greatest accuracy of 98.3%. Because a person's gait can be identified not just from one but three directions, using only one axis results in lesser accuracy than using data from all three axes. \u00a9 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

            "The way a person walks has unique characteristics for each individual and can be used to recognize them. There are various ways to classify characteristics for gait of each individual, one of them is the inertia sensor. The inertia sensor is used to collect data gait signals, which are angular velocity variations caused by human walking movements. Multidistance Signal Level Difference Sample Entropy is proposed in this study as a feature extraction before classifying individual gaits. MSLD is used to measure the co-occurrence of two signal samples at a distance d, and SampEn quantizes signal complexity. The MSLD Entropy produce 60 features in the form of SampEn at distances of 1 until 20 from the threeaxis. The testing procedure is carried out on the MSLD Entropy result signal for each classifier with a feature in the form of SampEn at distances of d=1-20, d=1-15, d=1-10, and d=1-5. Softmax regression as a classifier and feature at distance 1 until 20, the test results produce the greatest accuracy of 98.3%. Because a person's gait can be identified not just from one but three directions, using only one axis results in lesser accuracy than using data from all three axes. \u00a9 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

Parametric studies are carried out to determine the parameters of guard-trace, including the number of vias and the via diameter. To investigate the effectiveness of guard trace utilization for EM coupling reduction, a two-elements microstrip patch antenna array with a guard trace is designed to work at the frequency of 2.4 GHz. While to verify the design, the prototype of microstrip patch antenna array is realized and characterized. Measurement results indicate a coupling reduction of about 5 dB can be achieved when a 4-vias guard trace with the via diameter of 1 mm is inserted between the antenna patches separated by an edge-to-edge distance of 4 mm. Since the strongest coupling reduction occurs at very close distances between antennas, implementation of the proposed concept to massive elements antenna arrays is potential to reduce their footprint.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

However, security problems appear related to digital data. There were several information security incidents in the academic environment. In order to mitigate the problem, metrics identification is required to determine the risk of incidents. There are many risks model and metrics to estimate the risk, such as DREAD, OWASP, CVSS, etc. However, specific metrics are required to obtain appropriate risk values. Therefore, this study aims to define metrics for an academic institution. The proposed metrics are obtained from The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulation. It consists of directory information, educational information, personally identifiable information, and risk of information leakage. In order to achieve the objective, this study involves survey and reliability analysis to result in output. The survey is conducted by involving 90 respondents with various levels of education and jobs. The Cronbach's alpha and Test-retest are methods to determine this study's reliability. According to reliability analysis, the Cronbach's alpha method results in coefficients for the metrics between 0.730-0.911, while the Test-retest method results in coefficients between 0.630-0.797. These coefficients have a reliable category, so the proposed metrics are adequate for determining risk of information security incidents in academic environments. The reliable metrics will be developed as variables of the risk assessment model for the academic environment in the future study. \u00a9 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.",

But the detection process also takes a long time and requires a large amount of money. So, this study proposed a deep learning method using CNN by implementing the MobilenetV2 architecture, which is a lightweight model and mobile-friendly architecture. In this study, we used the primary dataset from the APTOS 2019 dataset, which contains 3662 retinal fundus images. Diabetic retinopathy is divided into 5 classes, starting from No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR. To produce an optimal class classification in this study, first balance the dataset scheme to 800 in each class by using image augmentation and implementing circle cropping. So, the highest results are obtained with this method with the following parameters: batch size of 32, learning rate of 0.001, RMSProp optimizer, and epoch 100. Testing accuracy is 92.6% as a result of this parameter. The macro precision, recall, and f1-score are 92.8%, 92.6%, and 92.4%, respectively. Our results show that augmentation techniques and circle crop methods can make the MobileNetV2 architecture bring good performance results, and several parameters can bring significant system performance results. This research will provide information that MobileNetV2 has a good result on the parameters and this will be a lightweight model to classify DR into 5 classes. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

            "The current business environment has no room for inefficiency as it can cause companies to lose out to their competitors, to lose customer trust, and to experience cost overruns. Business processes within the company continue to grow and cause them to run more complex. The large scale and complexity of business processes pose a challenge in improving the quality of process model because the effectiveness of time and the efficiency of existing resources are the biggest challenges. In the context of optimizing business processes with a process mining approach, most current process models are optimized with a trace clustering approach to explore the model and to perform analysis on the resulting process model. Meanwhile, in the event log data, not only the activities but also the other resources, such as records of employee or staff working time, process service time, and processing costs, are recorded. This article proposes a mechanism alternative to optimize business processes by exploring the resources that occur in the process. The mechanism is carried out in three stages. The first stage is optimizing the job shop scheduling method from the generated event log. Scheduling the time becomes a problem in the job shop. Utilizing the right time can increase the effectiveness of performance in order to reduce costs. Scheduling can be defined as the allocation of multiple jobs in a series of machines, in which each machine only does one job at a time. In general, scheduling becomes a problem when sequencing the operations and allocating them into specific time slots without prolonging the technical and capacity constraints. The second stage is generating the resource value that is recorded in the event log from the results of analysis of the previous stage, namely, job shop scheduling. The resource values are multivariate and then clustered to determine homogeneous clusters. The last stage is optimizing the nonlinear multipolynomials in the homogeneous cluster formed by using the Hessian solution. The results obtained are analyzed to get recommendations on business processes that are appropriate for the company's needs. The impact of long waiting times will increase service costs, but by improving workload, costs can be reduced. The process model and the value of service costs resulting from the mechanism in the research can be a reference for process owners in evaluating and improving ongoing processes.  \u00a9 2023 Hanung Nindito Prasetyo et al.",

These cities, situated in low-latitude regions, were hypothesized to share a magnetic conjugate relationship. Utilizing data from GNSS Ionospheric Monitor during the equinox season of March 2022, the study found that the GXGN station recorded a higher overall mean TEC value of 45.38 TECU compared to INTU's 28.64 TECU. The study reveals notable anomalies in daily ROTI values, INTU exhibiting irregularities on Day 52 and Day 93, while GXGN showed anomalies on Day 77. These findings warrant further investigation into the potential magnetic conjugate relationship between the two stations. The primary contribution of this paper is to investigate the ionospheric conditions and their implications for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals. Specifically, the study aims to understand the TEC and ROTI variations, their effect on the accuracy and reliability of the GNSS signal, and whether the two stations exhibit a magnetic conjugate relationship.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

The implementation of gait analysis was monitored by placing the Kinect V2 2.5 m next to the path of a person walking on a treadmill. We recorded subject walking using the Kinect V2 and the Kinect Software Development Kit (SDK) and produced skeleton tracking data.

The proposed EM wave absorber configuration is mainly constructed by an array of 2-dimensionally grounded open ring resonators on a dielectric substrate. The varactor diode with varied reverse direct current (DC) bias voltages is loaded into the open ring resonator of EM wave absorber configuration for achieving the tunable frequency operation.

            "Caching is an essential component of Named Data Networking (NDN), enabling efficient and scalable content distribution for future networks. The caching strategy regulates content distribution by deciding which network nodes are most suited to store duplicates of popular data. Hence, cache placement decisions are crucial to the NDN cache strategy. According to a prior study, caching decisions should consider the availability of cache storage for each node, the network's structure, and the content's popularity. However, all those criteria are not considered simultaneously in the decision-making process. Ignoring critical criteria can lead to destructive and ineffective decisions. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) improves NDN efficiency in caching decisions. This paper introduces C3CPS, a novel caching placement strategy based on MCDM using CoCoSo and CRITIC weighting method for enhanced content distribution. C3CPS considers five criteria, including two related to the network topologies, two related to cache storage, and the popularity of the content. Then, C3CPS examines these criteria with the CRITIC method to determine the weight of each criterion and the CoCoSo method to determine the optimal cache node. The ICARUS simulator validates C3CPS. The results show that the C3CPS outperforms other alternative caching techniques on cache hit rate, latency, and path stretch. \u00a9 2023 The Authors",

Although household consumption is an essential source of economic growth, households\u2019 failure to meet their financial obligations will be one of the causes of economic problems if the increase in consumption is largely financed by household borrowing. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the nexus between households\u2019 indebtedness and consumption and the roles of household characteristics. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study uses a microdata set of the Household Expenditure and Income Survey in 2019, which contained a simple random sampling of 4,730 households. Findings: Using a simultaneous equations model, our results show a negative nexus between households\u2019 consumption and their indebtedness. We find that household savings and size have an indirect impact on the debt service ratio, while the assets and total debt repayment instalments indirectly influence household consumption. We also identify differences in the relationship between the gender of the household head, rural and urban locations and income groups in consumption and indebtedness. Research limitations\/implications: The implication of this study is that governments should adopt several programmes to increase the awareness of household financial and debt management, especially for those in the low-income group.

The diverse altitude-related conditions make accurate temperature and humidity prediction challenging. To address this challenge, we propose harnessing the power of neural networks and IoT methods to predict temperature and humidity at different heights within TULT buildings.

The tsunami early warning system deployed in Indonesia was ineffective since it could only detect tsunamis based on earthquake data. Therefore, a tsunami early warning system based on sea level data is needed. In this paper, we designed a machine-learning-based tsunami early warning system using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) method to classify tsunami and non-Tsunami signals based on sea level data. As a study case, we use sea level data obtained from the Inexpensive Device for Sea Level Measurement (IDSL) in Marina Jambu that have been artificially added with tsunami signals from the 2018 tsunami caused by the landslide of Mount Anak Krakatau to increase the number of tsunami signals. After performing feature engineering and data imbalanced handling techniques such as adding lag and time features and applying class weight, we obtained good results from the XGBoost with a macro average F1-score of 0.76.

The proposed shape of patch intended for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)\/electromagnetic interference (EMI) measurement is generated based on the bandwidth response considerations from the shift of control points on the quadratic B\u00e8zier spline that forms an oval shape of patch. The behavior of each control point, when its coordinates are changed, is investigated and utilized to improve the bandwidth characteristic compared to the oval patch. The combination of shifting several control points on the shape of spearhead patch is then optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. The optimized spearhead-shaped patch could produce a geometric bandwidth of 215.6% from the frequency of 3.08 GHz to more than 20 GHz. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Well-known risk factors include hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, along with exposure to aflatoxins, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Genomic variants play a crucial role in mediating the associations between these risk factors and liver cancer. However, the specific variants involved in this process remain under-explored. This study utilized a bioinformatics approach to identify genetic variants associated with liver cancer from various continents. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with liver cancer were retrieved from the genome-wide association studies catalog. Prioritization was then performed using functional annotation with HaploReg v4.1 and the Ensembl database. The prevalence and allele frequencies of each variant were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Two variants, rs2294915 and rs2896019, encoded by the PNPLA3 gene, were found to be highly expressed in the liver tissue, as well as in the skin, cell-cultured fibroblasts, and adipose-subcutaneous tissue, all of which contribute to the risk of liver cancer. We further found that these two SNPs (rs2294915 and rs2896019) were positively correlated with the prevalence rate. Positive associations with the prevalence rate were more frequent in East Asian and African populations. We highlight the utility of this population-specific PNPLA3 genetic variant for genetic association studies and for the early prognosis and treatment of liver cancer. This study highlights the potential of integrating genomic databases with bioinformatic analysis to identify genetic variations involved in the pathogenesis of liver cancer. The genetic variants investigated in this study are likely to predispose to liver cancer and could affect its progression and aggressiveness.

The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a smart metering system integrated by a communication system outfitted with a communication network and data management system that allows utilities and consumers to communicate in both directions which is expected to increase efficiency in monitoring kwhMeter activity detection. However, the meter on this electricity is still separate and placed in different locations both in the apartment and at home, the plan of this thesis proposes the design, development, and support of the development of advanced metering infrastructure. Based on the planning result, LoRa WAnis Planning at least 22 gateways to roll out smart metering services in the Bandung metropolitan region with a Spreading Factor (SF) of 11, a Code Rate (CR) of 5\/6\/7\/8, and a receiver sensitivity level of more than -160.53 dBm are required. The average received signal is -62.95 dBm, with a throughput distribution of 5.42 kbps, according to LoRaWancoverage projections. Meanwhile, the simulated SNR yielded a maximum SNR of 35 dB and a minimum SNR of -20 dB, providing an average SNR level of roughly 22.04 dB over the region. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

We derive the degree distribution of variable nodes (VND) and check nodes (CND) from the parity check matrix (PCM) of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TS.38.212 and use them for DE analysis assuming of no cycle or girth. With several number of iterations, we found that 5G NR QC-LDPC of BG2 mother codes have a threshold of e = 0.2809. The DE analysis shows that the rateless capability with the extended parity successfully correct the error for higher e, without suffering from the error-floor (although many degree-1s exist), but slightly loose in gap from the Shannon limit.

            "The current business environment has no room for inefficiency as it can cause companies to lose out to their competitors, to lose customer trust, and to experience cost overruns. Business processes within the company continue to grow and cause them to run more complex. The large scale and complexity of business processes pose a challenge in improving the quality of process model because the effectiveness of time and the efficiency of existing resources are the biggest challenges. In the context of optimizing business processes with a process mining approach, most current process models are optimized with a trace clustering approach to explore the model and to perform analysis on the resulting process model. Meanwhile, in the event log data, not only the activities but also the other resources, such as records of employee or staff working time, process service time, and processing costs, are recorded. This article proposes a mechanism alternative to optimize business processes by exploring the resources that occur in the process. The mechanism is carried out in three stages. The first stage is optimizing the job shop scheduling method from the generated event log. Scheduling the time becomes a problem in the job shop. Utilizing the right time can increase the effectiveness of performance in order to reduce costs. Scheduling can be defined as the allocation of multiple jobs in a series of machines, in which each machine only does one job at a time. In general, scheduling becomes a problem when sequencing the operations and allocating them into specific time slots without prolonging the technical and capacity constraints. The second stage is generating the resource value that is recorded in the event log from the results of analysis of the previous stage, namely, job shop scheduling. The resource values are multivariate and then clustered to determine homogeneous clusters. The last stage is optimizing the nonlinear multipolynomials in the homogeneous cluster formed by using the Hessian solution. The results obtained are analyzed to get recommendations on business processes that are appropriate for the company's needs. The impact of long waiting times will increase service costs, but by improving workload, costs can be reduced. The process model and the value of service costs resulting from the mechanism in the research can be a reference for process owners in evaluating and improving ongoing processes.  \u00a9 2023 Hanung Nindito Prasetyo et al.",

Variations in Total Electron Content (TEC) and Rate of TEC Index (ROTI) within the ionosphere can significantly influence the accuracy and reliability of these signals. This research conducts a comprehensive statistical analysis of TEC variations and ROTI between two strategically located stations: INTU in Bandung City, Indonesia (Lat -6.98N, Lon 107.63E), and GXGN in Guilin City, China (Lat 25.35N, Lon 110.35E). These cities, situated in low-latitude regions, were hypothesized to share a magnetic conjugate relationship. Utilizing data from GNSS Ionospheric Monitor during the equinox season of March 2022, the study found that the GXGN station recorded a higher overall mean TEC value of 45.38 TECU compared to INTU's 28.64 TECU. The study reveals notable anomalies in daily ROTI values, INTU exhibiting irregularities on Day 52 and Day 93, while GXGN showed anomalies on Day 77.

Typically, cardiovascular disease tests involve electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. In recent years, researchers have explored the application of Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals for cardiovascular detection due to their non-invasive, efficient, accessible, and cost-effective nature. While deep learning has been successful in object detection in digital images, its application to PCG signals for heart attack detection is rare. This study bridges this gap by introducing an enhanced technique called the Myocardial Infarction Detection System (MIDs). In contrast to previous deep learning research, this study employs a transfer learning algorithm as a classifier for MI feature datasets. Feature extraction is performed in segments to obtain more accurate MI features. Six feature extraction methods and transfer learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using the VGG-16 architecture were selected as the primary components for MI identification. Additionally, this study compares these models with other CNN transfer learning models, such as VGG-19 and Xception, to assess their performance.

As we know, social media is widely used to express many things such as daily activities, expressing complaints, and also use for expressing their emotions for example about online lecture in the form of text such as on Twitter. In this research, an analysis related to the implementation of online lectures in Indonesia has been carried out. This research was conducted to find out opinions related to the existing system by detecting emotions in tweets using the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm. Based on research conducted by Shaver related to basic emotions in Indonesian, that emotions will be divided into five classes like happy, sadness, angry, fear, and love. In this final project, the five classes are divided into four emotion classes (happy, angry, fear, and love) and three emotion classes (angry, happy, and love). The data used are tweets taken on Github and also web scraping on Twitter which is implemented into the website. The model that has been made tested using Confusion Matrix to find out whether the model used to detect emotions can be said good. The result of final project research show that emotion detection system based on text related to the implementation of online lectures get 80% of accuracy for three class of emotions with test size 0.5, 73.20% for four class of emotion with test size 0.1, and 60.87% for five class of emotions with test size 0.1.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

            "The Covid - 19 pandemics first appeared for the first time on 2020 in Indonesia. This pandemic caused many changes in various aspect such as education and social life and it also increasing internet use in Indonesia. As we know, social media is widely used to express many things such as daily activities, expressing complaints, and also use for expressing their emotions for example about online lecture in the form of text such as on Twitter. In this research, an analysis related to the implementation of online lectures in Indonesia has been carried out. This research was conducted to find out opinions related to the existing system by detecting emotions in tweets using the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm. Based on research conducted by Shaver related to basic emotions in Indonesian, that emotions will be divided into five classes like happy, sadness, angry, fear, and love. In this final project, the five classes are divided into four emotion classes (happy, angry, fear, and love) and three emotion classes (angry, happy, and love). The data used are tweets taken on Github and also web scraping on Twitter which is implemented into the website. The model that has been made tested using Confusion Matrix to find out whether the model used to detect emotions can be said good. The result of final project research show that emotion detection system based on text related to the implementation of online lectures get 80% of accuracy for three class of emotions with test size 0.5, 73.20% for four class of emotion with test size 0.1, and 60.87% for five class of emotions with test size 0.1.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

This study aims to enhance spell checker performance through the implementation of various text preprocessing techniques, including case folding, tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning model, was employed in this research to facilitate the overall process. The study utilized data gathered from social media communities, comprising a total of 10,000 entries. This data was divided into two subsets; 80% (8,000 entries) was allocated for training and the remaining 20% (2,000 entries) was designated for testing. A series of tests were conducted on datasets subject to different preprocessing approaches: without case folding, without stop words removal, without stemming, and with all text preprocessing stages implemented. The evaluation metrics employed in this study included accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1 score. The results demonstrated notable improvements in spell checker performance with appropriate text preprocessing. Specifically, the accuracy reached 0.86 for the dataset without stemming, 0.74 for the dataset without stop words removal, 0.7 for the dataset without case folding, and 0.89 for the dataset where all preprocessing stages were applied. These findings suggest that a comprehensive text preprocessing approach, paired with deep learning models, can significantly enhance spell checker performance for Bahasa Indonesia. \u00a9 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

Treatment of bone fractures is generally done by radiological examination. X-ray is a tool that is commonly used to detect bone fractures because it is the easiest and fastest. However, the use of X-rays in the long term can cause radiation effects of ionizing radiation. Therefore, it is necessary to use alternative imaging methods.

Validation was performed using analytical solutions of the linear weakly dispersive (LWD) model, as well as experimental data. The NH-1L model was capable of describing the generation and propagation of water waves by a submarine landslide from relatively intermediate water to shallow water depths. \u00a9 2023 by the authors."

To handle these issues, this research proposed the use of a Single propeller drone design, drone with only 1 propeller, that can lower the cost of making the drone unit and ease the data gathering process. The single propeller drone gathers data for the air quality measurement device that uses DHT22 as the humidity and temperature sensor and MQ-135 as the air quality sensor. From the test result, carried out on Sukapura Football Field, Bandung, Indonesia, the single propeller was able to obtain the air quality, sent it to Google Firebase, and displayed it using smartphone. The test showed a slight difference result in the air quality data between different placements of the sensors on the single propeller drone. The test also showed the difference between stationary single propeller drone, which gave 103 ppm, with hovering drone, which gave 124 ppm. Furter test showed there were no differences between temperature and humidity result, with a maximum of 24oC and 99.6% humidity.

The model implements the Hybrid Fictitious Domain-Immersed Boundary (HFD-IB) method for representing the pipeline structure in the computational domain. The simulated flow fields are validated by experimental data for the developed flow around a pipeline over scoured beds, resulting in favorable results for velocity profiles. Further, three inter-phase drag models, the EF (Engelund and Freds\u00f8e, 1976), RZ (Richardson and Zaki, 1997), and ERZ (Lee and Huang, 2018) are applied and subsequently examined in simulating pipeline scouring, particularly the effects on the flow field, sediment transport, and the resulting scour profile during the onset and tunnel erosion stages. The models produce consistent results with the measured scour profile. All models show that buoyancy is dominant in driving the sand movements within and near the bed surface in both stages. Meanwhile, the drag force is dominant for sand transport above the bed where the inter-phase relative velocity is high. However, the three models differently capture the physical behaviors of the particle response time and relative velocity near the bed surface and within the bed, which impact the computed drag force and, thus, the resulting scour profile. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

            "The purpose of this research is to classify air pollution using an ensemble learning. Air pollution is one type of problem that is triggered by air pollutant substances. In many cases, air pollution can cause several diseases that impact long-Term health. Substances that can cause air pollution include Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (03), Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5), and Particulate Matter 10 (PM10). In recent years, many methods have been proposed to detect air pollution but still use classical machine learning as the classification method. However, the accuracy does not increase when using classical machine learning, therefore this research uses an ensemble learning algorithm as a classifier because this method combines multiple classifier. The accuracy value obtained from the entire detection process is strongly influenced by the results at the classification stage. Therefore the authors propose the use of a classification algorithm that supports increased accuracy of air pollution detection. The proposed classification method with ensemble learning increases the accuracy. The experiment results show that the lowest f1-score is good class when detected using the default AdaBoost algorithm. The f1-score is 0%. After implementing hyperparameter tuning, there is an increase in the good class, ie.: 95%.

            "The purpose of this research is to classify air pollution using an ensemble learning. Air pollution is one type of problem that is triggered by air pollutant substances. In many cases, air pollution can cause several diseases that impact long-Term health. Substances that can cause air pollution include Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (03), Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5), and Particulate Matter 10 (PM10). In recent years, many methods have been proposed to detect air pollution but still use classical machine learning as the classification method. However, the accuracy does not increase when using classical machine learning, therefore this research uses an ensemble learning algorithm as a classifier because this method combines multiple classifier. The accuracy value obtained from the entire detection process is strongly influenced by the results at the classification stage. Therefore the authors propose the use of a classification algorithm that supports increased accuracy of air pollution detection. The proposed classification method with ensemble learning increases the accuracy. The experiment results show that the lowest f1-score is good class when detected using the default AdaBoost algorithm. The f1-score is 0%. After implementing hyperparameter tuning, there is an increase in the good class, ie.: 95%. The best class after hyperparameter tuning on the AdaBoost algorithm is a hazardous class with an f1-score of 100%. The accuracy value when using the AdaBoost algorithm by default is 62%. After hyperparameter tuning, the resulting accuracy is 97%.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

However, many retailers can also adapt and change using new communication channels. This change presents new challenges for fashion companies and retailers to integrate channels into omnichannel services. This study aims to analyze the factors influencing customer behavior in omnichannel services through their intention to accept and use new technology in shopping. This study adopts the UTAUT2 model by adding two new variables: personal innovation and perceived security. This model was tested on 353 samples from Uniqlo customers residing in Indonesia. This research method uses a Quantitative PLS-SEM approach. This study tested the outer model, inner model, and hypothesis t-test with a bootstrap procedure using SmartPLS software. The results showed that the performance expectation factor did not affect the omnichannel purchase intention variable because the t-statistic value is less than 1.65. Meanwhile, other factors such as effort expectation, social influences, habits, hedonic motivation, perceived security, and personal innovativeness affect omnichannel purchase intentions because the t-statistic value is more than 1.65. The most positive and significant factor is personal innovativeness. Based on the results of this study, it is revealed that digitalization creates challenges for companies in maintaining digital businesses.

PIR sensors are usually used to gather information about potentially hazardous object movements in the context of home security. Previous research has shown that the accuracy of movement detection depends on the number of sensors installed; the more sensors, the greater the accuracy. However, as the number of sensors increases, so does the detection time. Typically, systems with four sensors have an accuracy of about 90% and a detection time of 3 seconds. To address this issue, this research paper presents a solution using real-Time deep learning models to shorten the detection time of suspicious objects. This research also evaluates the performance of various deep learning methods to determine the best result (in terms of object detection time) for home security. Rigorous experiments have been conducted to check the performance of the proposed system, and the results showed a detection accuracy of over 90%. In addition, we identify the potential of this system to enhance home security efficiency and effectiveness by combining high accuracy and faster detection times.

The LQR controller, the inner-loop controller, is designed based on the derived BBS dynamics model. Then FLC, the outer-loop controller, is designed to get the desired tracking error dynamics. By using LQR-FLC, one can use the simple PD controller to design the tracking error dynamics. In addition, the estimator is designed to provide the controller with the full-states information. This research is worth investigating because the LQR-FLC scheme for controlling the BBS is missing in the literature.

The LQR controller, the inner-loop controller, is designed based on the derived BBS dynamics model. Then FLC, the outer-loop controller, is designed to get the desired tracking error dynamics. By using LQR-FLC, one can use the simple PD controller to design the tracking error dynamics. In addition, the estimator is designed to provide the controller with the full-states information. This research is worth investigating because the LQR-FLC scheme for controlling the BBS is missing in the literature. The experiment is carried out using a hardware in loop (HIL) scheme where MATLAB-Simulink is connected to a microcontroller. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed cascaded LQR-FLC. \u00a9 2023, ICROS, KIEE and Springer."

Abnormalities in the heart can usually be detected when there is an additional sound during an incomplete valve opening. Additional sounds in cardiac abnormalities can be called murmurs. Normal and murmur heart sound happen in different frequency. Therefore, frequency-based feature extraction can be used to classify heart sound. One of frequency domains is power spectrum that can be calculated for power by two frequency of signal, and it can clearly show the pattern of murmur and normal heart sound. In this research, the proposed feature extraction based on the power spectrum feature is used to become another option feature extraction for heart sound classification, which is different from previous heart sound classification studies. There are five types of feature extraction that developed base power spectrum, which are Mean Frequency, Total Power, Maximum Peak Frequency, 1st Spectral Moment, and 2nd Spectral moment. Several classifiers also are used to get the best classier base that features. The best selection feature of this research is Mean Frequency, with best classifier are Stochastic Gradient Descent and logistic regression and accuracy 93%. When all features are used for classifier, almost all of the models have the highest accuracy especially when classifier with mean frequency, 1st Spectral, and 2nd Spectral moment has good accuracy too. Using all features, the best classifier for heart sound case is Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes with accuracy reaching 100%.

The policy implication of the study is that policymakers cannot equalise policy to boost regional economic growth because every county has its specific characteristics. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Readability is a crucial concern for professionals and academics in various sectors and areas of interest, such as education, applied linguistics, text linguistics, library science, business, medical, and technical communication. The readability of texts, readability models, and related techniques have been the subject of numerous studies. In this study, we build a baseline readability model on Indonesian elementary school textbook. We tackled the task as a classification task, which classifies the text into three classes: grade 1, grade 2, and grade 4 that represent three elementary grades. We used traditional predictors or surface-based predictors, syllable patterns, and BERT-based model (IndoBERT) with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classification methods. The results showed that the IndoBERT neural representation with Support Vector Machine strategy outperforms other scenario with the accuracy of 73.4%.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

The purpose of this study is to predict the presence of these circulations and the impact of these circulations on the distribution of rain throughout Indonesia. The territory of Indonesia was divided into 14 clusters to determine the effect of CENS and MJO and observe the relation of which with extreme rainfall patterns in each area. The method used to predict these three phenomena is a statistical approach called vector autoregressive (VAR), which indicates the occurrence of global circulation and extreme rain in Indonesia. In the studied area, there is a cointegration or long-term relationship between variables, which can be anticipated using the vector error correction model (VECM). It is also found that the presence of CENS and MJO circulation can be predicted with the model error rate measured based on the MAPE values of 1.8518 and 0.0619.

Previous studies have a better understanding of consumer attitudes towards food packaging colours. However, few studies approached consumer attitudes from a design or art and humanities perspective. Using colour on package design allows small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to set a higher retail price and to create a premium look that is proper as a souvenir. This study uses a qualitative approach to discover the extent to which the perception of (un)common colours in packaging vary across two different consumer types. Methods One-on-one interviews were conducted to explore personal opinions. The purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used since this study focuses on tourists purchasing food souvenir products. This study involved small samples of 32 individuals (16 local tourists and 16 international travellers). During the interview, three sets of souvenir food packaging were shown to participants as stimuli. Data was coded with descriptive coding (open coding). Coding began by categorising the data using descriptive labels. The second analysis phase was the interpretive phase by axial coding. Results Both local and international groups perceived common and uncommon colours on packaging can create four functional values: brand searching and identification, colour strategy in branding, consumer attention, and brand positioning and competitive advantage. However, participants evaluated common and uncommon colours differently for emotional value creation. When more uncommon colours for both product categories and variants are used, additional perceptions may emerge. Additionally, the more common (congruent) colour, the more representative and informative the packaging design, which highlights the functional value. However, the uncommon colours give more emotional engagement. Conclusions There were differences in the functional value perception across two groups when common colour was applied to packaging. However, there was slight difference between two groups in the emotional value perception when applying the uncommon colour for packaging. Even though this study focuses on SME food souvenir packaging, the findings may have implications for other products' packaging displayed on the shelves.

            "Heavy rainfall during July 15\u201316, 2022 occurred over several western parts of Java Island. The recorded daily precipitation data reached about 155.2\u00a0mm\/day on the West Java Climatology station, exceeding the extreme rainfall threshold (100\u00a0mm\/day), while in this period, this area is generally experiencing a dry season. This paper aims to investigate the possible atmospheric mechanism resulting in extreme precipitation during this period using reanalysis and satellite data. We examined the atmospheric condition by analyzing cloud clusters, rainfall intensity, the vertical profile of temperature and humidity, and vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT) during the heavy rainfall period. The results indicate that a convective cloud system developed along the western coast of Java Island from the night (July 15, 2022) until morning (July 16, 2022). The convective cloud initially developed over the western coast of Java Island and propagated eastward toward the center of the mainland, then dissipated on 00 Local Time (LT) July 16, 2022, over the mainland. The new clusters then developed again from the prior clusters from the sea area and propagated in an eastward development over the southern and northern coast of the land until the morning of July 16, 2022. Rainfall conditions exhibited a consistent result with convective clouds, shown by the double peaks of rainfall intensity during the disaster and the similar spatial pattern and propagation of precipitation. Moreover, we observed a warm temperature anomaly in the upper troposphere (9\u201312\u00a0km) in accordance with high moisture over the Sunda Strait, indicating the latent heat released due to convective cloud formation on July 15, 2022. Furthermore, the high moisture content transported from the Java Sea and the coastal area over the southern part of Java Island toward the flooding locations (IVT over 300\u00a0kg m\u22121s\u22121) supported the convective cloud formation during July 15\u201316, 2022. Overall, this study indicates that the convective clouds and their sustained development, due to supportive environmental conditions, triggered heavy rainfall events over study locations. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

Many people do not realize that garbage can be a source of disease, environmental pollution and other negative things. Most people still often throw garbage carelessly. The local government has placed garbage bins in public spaces but people sometimes still throw out the garbage that doesnot fit the type. Disposing of garbage in the same place is considered to be difficult for garbage menagement because each type of garbage has a different time to decompose. It is necessary to classify garbage based on its basic ingredients so that garbage management becomes better and easier. Organic garbage can be used for fertilizer while non-organic garbage can be recycled. This research proposes to build a classifier that is able to distinguish the types of garbage. Transfer learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Network architecture is implemented in this research. Two pre-trained models are implemented-VGG16 and MobileNet, to train thousands of images from 12 types of garbage which are Battery, Biological, Brown-Glass, Cardboard, Clothes, Green-Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Shoes, Trash and White-Glass.

Researchers have developed NDN-based networks in recent years in an attempt to overcome the limitations of the TCP\/IP architecture. Named data networks using content names involve many things, including routing. Although NDN has a routing protocol, the current problem is that it has high overhead because the routing used by NDN is currently decentralized, where each synchronization and path update process uses broadcast packet delivery. To reduce broadcasts and reduce the overhead of creating a controller where the controller has a separate signaling path from the data path. How to combine NDN with centralized control and design the overall architecture to achieve good performance and overhead has been done by many previous researchers.

            "Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructure was successfully synthesized on an alumina substrate by the hydrothermal method. The hydrothermal method consists of two stages: the preparation of seeding layers and the growth of ZnO nanostructures. 0.4 M Zinc Acetate Dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2\u00b72H2O) and 3 M Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) were used as precursors. The hydrothermal process was carried out at 90\u00b0C for 4 hours. Morphological characterization of ZnO nanostructures was conducted by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The result produces a diameter of 60-80 nm and a length of 600-800 nm in the form of nanoflowers. The crystal and crystalline structure were studied with XRD, and it was shown that the ZnO nanostructure is a wurtzite structure in the form of a hexagonal shape and has a crystallite size of 59 nm. After conducting electrical characterization, it was shown that the current is directly proportional to the voltage, forming an ohmic contact curve. ZnO nanostructures have the potential to be applied as a gas sensor since the good response indicated the presence of butane gas. It is clarified that the nanostructure with a flow rate of 200 mL\/min has a change in resistance of 0.17 M\u03a9\/s with a recovery time of 30 seconds when it is exposed to butane gas for one minute. ZnO nanostructures also have a sensitivity change of 0.000495 M\u03a9\/mL in the gas flow rate range of 50-250 mL\/min. \u00a9 IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.",

This work develops a new metaheuristic called a multiple interaction optimizer (MIO). MIO has distinct mechanics in finding the optimal solution. MIO consists of two phases. In the first phase, each agent interacts with some randomly selected agents in the population. The guided search is conducted in every interaction. In the second phase, each agent carries out a local search which linearly reduces the search space during the iteration. Three tests are carried out on the performance of MIO. In the first test, the MIO is challenged to solve 23 functions. The second test is performed as the investigation of the hyper parameters. In the third test, MIO is challenged to solve the order allocation problem with the objective is minimizing the total cost, total lateness, and total defect. In this test, MIO is benchmarked with five metaheuristics: particle swarm optimization (PSO), marine predator algorithm (MPA), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), slime mould algorithm (SMA), and golden search optimizer (GSO). The result indicates that MIO is superior in solving both 23 functions and order allocation problems. In the theoretical test, MIO outperforms PSO, MPA, GWO, SMA, and GSO in 22, 21, 22, 19, and 18 functions respectively.

            "The continuously growing population and urban growth rates are responsible for the sharp rise in energy consumption, which leads to increased CO2emissions and demand-supply imbalances. The power sector is switching to alternative energy sources, including renewable energy resources (RES) such as Photovoltaic (PV) and wind power (WP) and battery energy storage systems (BESS), among others, due to an increase in the use of fossil fuels and their shortage. Since the power generation of these resources is uncertain due to climatic fluctuations and the direct integration of these resources into the power grid is very complex due to the issues such as; voltage and frequency regulation, overloading of active transmission lines, and supply-demand disparity, the research on system uncertainties is receiving increasing attention. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the several parameters of uncertainty, approaches for dealing with the uncertainty in battery energy storage (BES)-based RES integrated grid, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Moreover, various analytical and numerical approaches were developed for integrating RES and BESS into the power grid, including probabilistic methods, possibilistic methods, robust optimization-based techniques, and machine learning algorithms. The comparative analysis of these approaches highlights their relative strengths and weaknesses, providing a valuable resource for researchers and utility planners. Additionally, this review paper identifies several issues and challenges associated with the integration of RES and BESS into the power grid, such as power quality, economical effect, battery aging effect, and environmental effect. Furthermore, the paper suggests a few future research directions, including the development of novel models for analyzing uncertainty in power systems, coordination of uncertainty parameters, integration of BESS into RES and grid, power electronics integration, and environmental factor. Overall, this article's novel contributions include a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty parameters, a comparative analysis of uncertainty modeling approaches, an identification of critical issues and challenges, and the suggestion of future research directions to promote a sustainable and reliable power system. This article will aid in defining the requirements and specifications for novel models for analyzing uncertainty in power systems. The discussion and analysis will assist researchers and utility planners in selecting a suitable uncertainty modeling approach with significant penetrations of distributed RESs, which can lead to achieving a reliable and sustainable power system. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

The aim of this study is to see how FDI and innovation influence the ICT goods imports in ASEAN 6.

This is because installing a massive 5G network requires a large investment by network providers. For this reason, the authors propose an alternative beyond 5G that has better quality than 5G and a relatively lower investment value than 5G networks. This study aims to analyze the downlink of the cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, which is usually used in 5G, combined with the use of a reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS) antenna with decode and forward relay mechanisms. RIS is processed with a limited number of objects utilizing Rayleigh fading channels.

Under the Nakagami-m fading channel, the authors carefully evaluated the probability of loss for various users as a function of perfect channel statistical information (p-CSI) utilizing simply a single input-output (SISO) system with a finite number of RIS elements. As a key success metric, the efficiency of the proposed RIS-assisted NOMA transmission mechanism is evaluated through numerical data on the outage probability for each user.

The conventional methods for calculating wave run-up involve physical experiments or numerical modeling. Machine learning methods have recently become a part of wave run-up model development due to their robustness in dealing with large and complex data. In this paper, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based machine learning method is introduced for predicting wave run-up on a sloping beach. More than 400 laboratory observations of wave run-up were utilized as training datasets to construct the XGBoost model. The hyperparameter tuning through the grid search approach was performed to obtain an optimized XGBoost model. The performance of the XGBoost method is compared to that of three different machine learning approaches: multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF). The validation evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other machine learning approaches in predicting the wave run-up with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.98675, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.635%, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.03902. Compared to empirical formulas, which are often limited to a fixed range of slopes, the XGBoost model is applicable over a broader range of beach slopes and incident wave amplitudes. \u2022 The optimized XGBoost method is a feasible alternative to existing empirical formulas and classical numerical models for predicting wave run-up. \u2022 Hyperparameter tuning is performed using the grid search method, resulting in a highly accurate machine-learning model. \u2022 Our findings indicate that the XGBoost method is more applicable than empirical formulas and more efficient than numerical models. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s)",

            "Void is one type of defect emerging in composite material due to the missing of some elements during the fabrication process. The presence of voids can affect the mechanical properties and increase the potential damage of the composite. Voids possess micrometer size and various shapes, which requires a micrometer resolution technique for identification. This study aims to identify, classify, and count the number of voids in resin-covered fiberglass composite digital images, as well as to correlate the voids with the composite tensile strength. For that purpose, we applied the template matching method in digital image processing combining with the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) method to analyze the digital images of the composites prepared by dry-, wet-, and rolled-lay-up methods. We observed various shapes and sizes of voids present in the composite surface and correlated them with the composite tensile strength. Even t hough the samples are prepared with the same fabrication processes, the number of voids on each sample are varied. However, only voids with a diameter size larger than 70\u03bcm were found to influence the tensile strength strongly. The composite tensile strength tends to decrease with the increase of large voids numbers, whereas no consistent relation is observed between the number of small voids and tensile strength. We also found that RGB image templates are more accurate for localized void identification with a strong contrast with its surrounding. This study reveals the potential of digital image processing methods for identifying and characterizing various void geometries in composites.  \u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

However, rainwater that has been held for more than two months will be hazy and mossy in appearance. Rainwater must, therefore, first be treated to make it clearer. Rainwater was treated using clinoptilolite-type zeolite. We used two sizes of zeolite particles: large (0.02 cm) and small (0.002 cm). The zeolite was activated in an oven at 225 \u00b0C for 3 hours. After 50 hours of immersion, it was found that large-sized zeolite could lower the turbidity of rainwater by up to 86.2% without increasing the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) value. Small-sized zeolite might reduce the turbidity of rainwater by 8% for the same immersion time. These findings show that larger zeolites are more efficient at reducing rainwater turbidity. Large-sized zeolite does not require any further processing to be made smaller before use because it is readily available on the market. Furthermore, it showed that the zeolite-based rainwater treatment process employs the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. \u00a9 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.",

Even though the company is quite large and operates in the field of research and development of cars, the company only uses Microsoft Excel and WhatsApp in managing its training. That method raises several problems such as the lack of transparency of training data, the possibility that employees forget the training schedule, the possibility that training history is inaccurate, and making training reports takes a long time. Therefore, the company developed a system called the Training Management Information System (TAMIS) to improve the performance of its training management.

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), one of the multiple access techniques, has been researched to gain high spectral efficiency. Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), meanwhile, is an antenna technology that can increase the spectral efficiency of wireless networks. A combination of NOMA and MIMO is able to cope with an overloaded scenario. However, this benefit lies in the massive demand for accurate Channel State Information at Transmitter (CSIT). Imperfect CSIT can arise multiuser interference problems, a significant problem for wireless networks in MIMO technology. Another promising multiple access strategy, known as Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), has been researched for interference management. This multiple access scheme is expected to have better interference management capabilities for being more adaptive to the level of interference. When combined with MIMO systems, RSMA can overcome the imperfect conditions of CSIT compared to Power-Domain NOMA and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA). However, its performance on some user deployment conditions gives only a little sum rate enhancements. This paper proposes a multiple access technique using Rate-Splitting on a Multiuser MIMO system with power distribution adjustments.

            "The tourism industry is very important to prioritize, especially for developing countries like Thailand. The increase in tourist visits to Bangkok also triggers the potential for a rise in Bangkok tourism during the pandemic. In this study, shopping malls are one of the attractive attractions for a capital city like Bangkok. Tourist expectations of attraction must be realized so that satisfaction can be realized and created revisit. In the digitalization era, the internet's use to find and disseminate information has become commonplace. Tripadvisor.com is one of the leading review sites, which already has many reviewers, and is the case study in this research. Using Word Cloud as an analysis technique and clustering of data reviews, several important factors influence tourist satisfaction. Based on the 1186 clustered reviewers, several factors were produced, such as Place Quality, Location Access, Support Facilities, Price, and Seller Attitude. These factors can influence the decision to visit shopping malls in Bangkok because they represent tourist satisfaction. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Many efforts to develop tools to detect nearby vehicles to avoid crashes have been reported. However, most of them worked only on detecting cars. The research aims to detect motorcycles at night, to complement the previous studies, which mainly focused on cars. The research introduces four features which are extracted from the red pixel and edge map. The algorithm to extract the features has also been developed. They are applied to three commonly used classifiers: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to validate the effectiveness of the features. Since the public dataset related to the research is not available yet, the nighttime videos from YouTube have been collected. The datasets contain all the various levels of darkness. They are divided into an 80-20 ratio for training and testing sets to support the experiment and measure the validity of the proposed method. As the best result, the detection using ANN can detect motorcycle proposals with accuracy of 72.71%, precision of 65.10% and recall of 73.33%.

Given the volume of approximately 867 million daily tweets, the potential scale of cyberbullying incidents is immense, underscoring the necessity for automated detection systems for such messages. However, the context-sensitive nature of tweets can pose challenges to understanding message content, particularly in languages like Indonesian with potential for significant vocabulary discrepancies. This study aims to enhance cyberbullying detection by employing feature expansion using FastText, thereby addressing vocabulary-related comprehension issues in Indonesian-language tweets. Furthermore, text classification is performed using a Hybrid Deep Learning approach, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). This hybrid model leverages the strengths of both techniques, capturing local patterns and long-range dependencies within the data. The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance yielded by the application of FastText-enhanced feature expansion and Hybrid Deep Learning to an Indonesian Twitter dataset. This focus is motivated by the high accuracy of Hybrid Deep Learning for Twitter datasets in other languages, and the limited application of such methods to Indonesian-language datasets, which predominantly use supervised learning or deep learning. Analysis of 29,085 datasets demonstrated that the combined implementation of Hybrid Deep Learning and FastText-enhanced feature expansion achieved the highest accuracy, with CNN-BiLSTM and BiLSTM-CNN scoring 80.55% and 80.35% respectively. These findings validate the significant accuracy boost provided by FastText when integrated with Hybrid Deep Learning.

            "Heart sounds are essential in diagnosing and analyzing heart disease and detecting abnormalities in the heart. Abnormalities in the heart can usually be detected when there is an additional sound during an incomplete valve opening. Additional sounds in cardiac abnormalities can be called murmurs. Normal and murmur heart sound happen in different frequency. Therefore, frequency-based feature extraction can be used to classify heart sound. One of frequency domains is power spectrum that can be calculated for power by two frequency of signal, and it can clearly show the pattern of murmur and normal heart sound. In this research, the proposed feature extraction based on the power spectrum feature is used to become another option feature extraction for heart sound classification, which is different from previous heart sound classification studies. There are five types of feature extraction that developed base power spectrum, which are Mean Frequency, Total Power, Maximum Peak Frequency, 1st Spectral Moment, and 2nd Spectral moment. Several classifiers also are used to get the best classier base that features. The best selection feature of this research is Mean Frequency, with best classifier are Stochastic Gradient Descent and logistic regression and accuracy 93%. When all features are used for classifier, almost all of the models have the highest accuracy especially when classifier with mean frequency, 1st Spectral, and 2nd Spectral moment has good accuracy too. Using all features, the best classifier for heart sound case is Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes with accuracy reaching 100%. These excellent outcomes can elevate feature extraction to the top contender and help machine learning generate effective classifiers. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

            "Arrhythmia is a condition in which the heart beats faster or beats slower. In the fetus, arrhythmia is a fairly rare condition. However severe arrhythmias can lead to death and birth defects if not detected and treated properly. The early stages of detecting arrhythmias in the fetus can be done using an electrocardiogram (ECG). A normal ECG signal consisting of PQRST waves and an estimated heart rate can be used to diagnose arrhythmias. Manual examination of fetal arrhythmias is often impractical. Therefore, this study proposes a more effective and simple automatic detection system to detect fetal arrhythmias using segmentation of the ECG signal waveform in the form of PQRST waves with the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) method. This study uses 3 hidden layers with output channels of 16, ReLU activation, fully connected layer, flatten layer, dropout 0.5, and sigmoid activation. The dataset used is non-invasive fetal ECG arrhythmia from Physionet with two categories: Normal and arrhythmias. The best results obtained from this study are with the following parameters: AdaMax optimizer with fixed parameters learning rate of 0.001, epoch of 100, and batch size of 64 provide better performance with an accuracy of 96%. Based on the result, the proposed system has the potential to be used as a non-invasive tool for the early detection of arrhythmia in the fetus so that it can assist medical personnel in providing appropriate treatment. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

For Internet of Things technology, the author uses Arduino, which controls sensors and actuators, while Raspberry Pi is used to process data. In addition, the author uses ultrasonic sensors to measure the water level and a water pump to control the water level. So, if the water level exceeds the specified limit, the pump will move the water to another place, in this prototype, using an aquarium. For fuzzy logic, the criteria used are dry, filled, and full. In addition, this system is equipped with a website-based dashboard used to monitor real-time data from the sensor. The results of this study indicate the system is running well, with an average error of 32.2%. This indicates that the system has been well designed because the errors obtained are feasible to be minor, although there are several influencing factors, such as prototype construction and sensor readings.

Our result is achieved by employing a two-step research methodology: 1) We use bibliometric approaches to analyze contributions to business and economics research and provide a comprehensive mental health discussion in entrepreneurship and business environment in general by looking at the most significant foundation papers. 2) To back up these conclusions, a content analysis of the most relevant academic papers was carried out utilizing a broader database, describing the correlation between the studies of mental health and entrepreneurship at the individual and organizational levels. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "A knowledge graph (KG) is used to store knowledge in the form of connected facts. Facts in KG are represented in the form of a triple (subject, predicate, object) or (head, relation, tail). KG is widely used in question answering, information retrieval, classification, recommender systems, and so on. However, a common problem with KG is incomplete KG. A KG is called incomplete if there is a missing relationship between two entities. An incomplete KG can have an impact on decreasing the accuracy of a task that uses the KG. One solution to the incomplete KG is to use link prediction. Link prediction aims to predict the missing relationship between two entities in a KG. Another problem is that the size of KG is large, consisting of hundreds or millions of entities and relationships. Handling large KG also needs to be considered. Therefore, link prediction on large KG also needs to be considered so that the link prediction process is more efficient. This paper discusses link prediction using embedding to overcome the incomplete KG problem. In addition, it is proposed to use clustering to increase the efficiency of the link prediction process. Clustering is used to group the embedding results. After the embedding results are grouped, scoring and loss function calculations to predict missing links are carried out in groups that are considered appropriate. It is expected that with this grouping, the time of link prediction process can be more efficient because there is no need to check all the vectors in the embedding space. \u00a9 2023 Copyright held by the owner\/author(s).",

This data was divided into two subsets; 80% (8,000 entries) was allocated for training and the remaining 20% (2,000 entries) was designated for testing. A series of tests were conducted on datasets subject to different preprocessing approaches: without case folding, without stop words removal, without stemming, and with all text preprocessing stages implemented. The evaluation metrics employed in this study included accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1 score. The results demonstrated notable improvements in spell checker performance with appropriate text preprocessing. Specifically, the accuracy reached 0.86 for the dataset without stemming, 0.74 for the dataset without stop words removal, 0.7 for the dataset without case folding, and 0.89 for the dataset where all preprocessing stages were applied. These findings suggest that a comprehensive text preprocessing approach, paired with deep learning models, can significantly enhance spell checker performance for Bahasa Indonesia. \u00a9 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

            "Our previous research applied a novel classification-integrated moving average (CIMA) method, an intelligence method that improves the performance of passive infrared (PIR) sensors in smart lighting to make control more comfortable for the user. However, intelligence, closely related to cloud deployments with large latency effects, contradicts the real-time nature demanded by smart lighting. This paper proposes edge smart lighting (EdgeSL) architecture, an edge-computing architecture for real-time improved CIMA smart lighting control. We developed novel intelligent control using permutation importance feature selection to improve the CIMA algorithm. Three model compression methods for the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model are compared, including the novel knowledge distillation on KNN called DistilKNN. The KNN model is the basis of CIMA. The method allows the model to run in an edge-computing environment. The experiment was carried out by evaluating processing time in three different environments, namely edge, fog, and cloud architecture. Our test results show that DistilKNN has the best accuracy compared to other methods, including pruning and quantization, which is 0.93. After deploying the compressed model to the NodeMCU, edge computing has a lower average processing time than fog computing and cloud computing, namely 9.0, 60.1, and 207.6 ms, respectively. After going through the Shapiro-Wilk test, we learned that the three processing times are not normally distributed. So after testing with the Wilcoxon test, it is proved that the EdgeSL has the best performance, where the average processing time with the other architectures has significant differences.  \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

An artificial intelligence-based approach is needed to make it easier for doctors to diagnose ear diseases based on ear image information, such as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This paper describes how CNN was designed to generate CNN models used to classify ear diseases.

The result from capacity planning shows that in fifth-year development, the optimistic conditions need at least 63 gNodeB, the moderate condition needs at least 47 gNodeB, and the pessimistic condition needs at least 32 gNodeB. The coverage approach shows that DKI Jakarta requires 232 downlink sites and 147 uplink sites. \u00a9 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved."

We use the existing standard of FRMCS, especially the frequency and the bandwidth, for the performance evaluations. To derive the Indonesia channel models, we consider the environmental parameters of Bandung City expecting that Bandung can represent the conditions of almost many cities of Indonesia. To solve the trade-off between frequency and path loss, we perform a series of computer simulations in terms of cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received power, channel capacity, and outage probability to support the analysis in this paper. We found that the capacity of FRMCS at 1900 MHz is higher compared to that at 900 MHz although the frequency of 1900 MHz may experience higher loss compared to 900 MHz. This result is expected to help the analysis required for the decision on the suitable frequency as well as the expected capacity of the Indonesia FRMCS.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "Classification of text documents on online media is a big data problem and requires automation. Text classification accuracy can decrease if there are many ambiguous terms between classes. Hadoop Map Reduce is a parallel processing framework for big data that has been widely used for text processing on big data. The study presented text classification using genetic programming by pre-processing text using Hadoop map-reduce and collecting data using web scraping. Genetic programming is used to perform association rule mining (ARM) before text classification to analyze big data patterns. The data used are articles from science-direct with the three keywords. This study aims to perform text classification with ARM-based data pattern analysis and data collection system through web-scraping, pre-processing using map-reduce, and text classification using genetic programming. Through web scraping, data has been collected by reducing duplicates as much as 17718. Map-reduce has tokenized and stopped-word removal with 36639 terms with 5189 unique terms and 31450 common terms. Evaluation of ARM with different amounts of multi-tree data can produce more and longer rules and better support. The multi-tree also produces more specific rules and better ARM performance than a single tree. Text classification evaluation shows that a single tree produces better accuracy (0.7042) than a decision tree (0.6892), and the lowest is a multi-tree(0.6754). The evaluation also shows that the ARM results are not in line with the classification results, where a multi-tree shows the best result (0.3904) from the decision tree (0.3588), and the lowest is a single tree (0.356). \u00a9 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

            "An accurate vertical wind speed (WS) data estimation is required to determine the potential for wind farm installation. In general, the vertical extrapolation of WS at different heights must consider different parameters from different locations, such as wind shear coefficient, roughness length, and atmospheric conditions. The novelty presented in this article is the introduction of two steps optimization for the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model to estimate WS at different heights using measurements from lower heights. The first optimization of the RNN is performed to minimize a differentiable cost function, namely, mean squared error (MSE), using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Secondly, the RNN is optimized to reduce a non-differentiable cost function using simulated annealing (RNN-SA), namely mean absolute error (MAE). Estimation of WS vertically at 50 m height is done by training RNN-SA with the actual WS data a 10\u201340 m heights. The estimated WS at height of 50 m and the measured WS at 10\u201340 heights are further used to train RNN-SA to obtain WS at 60 m height. This procedure is repeated continuously until the WS is estimated at a height of 180 m. The RNN-SA performance is compared with the standard RNN, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and state of the art methods like convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extrapolate the WS vertically. The estimated values are also compared with real WS dataset acquired using LiDAR and tested using four error metrics namely, mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean bias error (MBE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The numerical experimental results show that the MSE values between the estimated and actual WS at 180 m height for the RNN-SA, RNN, MLP, and SVM methods are found to be 2.09, 2.12, 2.37, and 2.63, respectively. \u00a9 2023, Tech Science Press.

Although NDN has a routing protocol, the current problem is that it has high overhead because the routing used by NDN is currently decentralized, where each synchronization and path update process uses broadcast packet delivery.

This research presents a thorough case for integrating machine learning to foster sustainability and waste reduction. The contribution of this research is notable for its integration of RoBERTa and BERTopic in multilabel classification tasks and topic modeling in the fashion industry. The results indicate that the RoBERTa model exhibits remarkable performance, as demonstrated by its macro-averaged F1 score of 0.87 and micro-averaged F1 score of 0.87.

In the first phase, we determine menu items that the pricing cut will be applied to using menu engineering, one of the methods used in the restaurant industry to evaluate menu items performance. In the next phase, we forecast demand for the next period by modeling the effect of price on sales history. In the third phase, the demand model is substituted into the dynamic pricing model, which is then optimized by using non-linear programming method. The optimization result shows that the proposed model can increase restaurant revenue up to 28% compared to historical revenue.

The objective of this research is to develop a prediction model for air condition outside Telkom University Landmark Tower (TULT) using the Internet of Things (IoT) approach and Regression Tree Ensembles (RTE). In this study, the RTE technique is employed as the prediction method that combines multiple regression trees to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Historical data collected from the TULT building serves as the training dataset for the model. To assess the model's performance, evaluation is conducted utilizing the R-squared ($R^{2}$) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) methods to quantify the error. The evaluation on temperature measurements show that the model achieves a low MAE of 0.28608 in the test data. In the training data, the MAE is even lower, at 0.00397. For humidity measurements, the model exhibits a higher MAE of 7.0043 in the test data, indicating higher error rates in humidity predictions. Similarly, the MAE in the training data is 0.1086, showing that the model performs better on the data it was trained on but still experiences higher errors in the test data. In terms of $R^{2}$ values, the model achieves an $R^{2}$ of 0.3159 in the test data for temperature measurement, indicating that it can explain approximately 31.59% of the variance in temperature data. In the training data, the $R^{2}$ value is much higher at 0.9949. Interested readers can use the data from this website https:\/\/socj.telkomuniversity.ac.id\/data\/.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Readability is a crucial concern for professionals and academics in various sectors and areas of interest, such as education, applied linguistics, text linguistics, library science, business, medical, and technical communication. The readability of texts, readability models, and related techniques have been the subject of numerous studies. In this study, we build a baseline readability model on Indonesian elementary school textbook. We tackled the task as a classification task, which classifies the text into three classes: grade 1, grade 2, and grade 4 that represent three elementary grades. We used traditional predictors or surface-based predictors, syllable patterns, and BERT-based model (IndoBERT) with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classification methods. The results showed that the IndoBERT neural representation with Support Vector Machine strategy outperforms other scenario with the accuracy of 73.4%.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

In outdoor applications, internet sources such as WIFI are not always available, so it requires alternative data communications such as nRF24l01. The system also requires a portable power source such as solar power. This research aims to develop a vibration propagation analysis system based on the nRF24l01 wireless sensor network and solar power by implementing the fuzzy rule-based regression (FRBR) algorithm. The system consists of two piezoelectric and nrf24l01 vibration sensors. The system also uses a third node equipped with temperature and soil moisture sensors, air temperature and humidity, and light intensity as environmental variables. The evaluation results show the Quality of Services (QoS) results with a throughput of 99.564%, PDR 99.675%, and a delay of 0.0073s. The Fuzzy Association Rule (FAR) extraction results yield nine rules with average support of 0.319 and confidence of 1 for vibration propagation. The availability of solar power was evaluated with an average current value of 0.250A and a voltage of 3.266V. The results of FRBR are based on the propagation of the vibration that propagated and produced a mean square error (MSE) of 0.141 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.165. The correlation matrix and FAR results show that only soil moisture has a major effect on the magnitude and duration of propagation.

Most of the previous studies focused on the passive control method involve the changes in initial conditions of the systems including the geometry. However, the effects of primary air entrance of MCJ plates need to be investigated further. This paper aims to determine the effects of MCJ plates geometry on the burner combustion using the flame visualization technique. The plates are represented by P1, P2, and P3 characterized by the difference in the open area ratio at 17.8, 18.4 and 18.9 respectively. In the experiments, the flame images of all plates are captured at equivalence ratios of 0.8 to 1.2 using a Digital Single Lens Reflect camera. The flame temperatures are measured using the infra-red imaging technique while the emissions, burning chamber and stack temperature are also recorded using an emission gas analyzer and K-type thermocouples respectively. Image processing technique was used to analyze the data. Results show that an increase in open area ratio increases the flame temperature up to 11.4%.

In terms of effectiveness and ease of access to information in monitoring the supporting condition factors and facilitating the farmers, an Android-based monitoring system was built to monitor the growth of nursery plants.

Unfortunately, almost all metaheuristics are not equipped with an adaptive approach that makes them change their strategy when stagnation happens during iteration. Based on this consideration, a new metaheuristic, called an adaptive balance optimizer (ABO), is proposed in this paper. ABO's unique strategy focuses on exploitation when improvement happens and switching to exploration during stagnation. ABO also uses a balanced strategy between exploration and exploitation by performing two sequential searches, whatever circumstance it faces. These sequential searches consist of one guided search and one random search. Moreover, ABO also deploys both a strict acceptance approach and a non-strict acceptance approach. In this work, ABO is challenged to solve a set of 23 classic functions as a theoretical optimization problem and a portfolio optimization problem as the use case for the practical optimization problem.

            "The disposability of clothing has emerged as a critical concern, precipitating waste accumulation due to product quality degradation. Such consequences exert significant pressure on resources and challenge sustainability efforts. In response, this research focuses on empowering clothing companies to elevate product excellence by harnessing consumer feedback. Beyond insights, this research extends to sustainability by providing suggestions on refining product quality by improving material handling, gradually mitigating waste production, and cultivating longevity, therefore decreasing discarded clothes. Managing a vast influx of diverse reviews necessitates sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our study introduces a Robustly optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model calibrated for multilabel classification and BERTopic for topic modeling.

            "The disposability of clothing has emerged as a critical concern, precipitating waste accumulation due to product quality degradation. Such consequences exert significant pressure on resources and challenge sustainability efforts. In response, this research focuses on empowering clothing companies to elevate product excellence by harnessing consumer feedback. Beyond insights, this research extends to sustainability by providing suggestions on refining product quality by improving material handling, gradually mitigating waste production, and cultivating longevity, therefore decreasing discarded clothes. Managing a vast influx of diverse reviews necessitates sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our study introduces a Robustly optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model calibrated for multilabel classification and BERTopic for topic modeling. The model adeptly distills vital themes from consumer reviews, exhibiting astounding accuracy in projecting concerns across various dimensions of clothing quality.

In the first phase, we determine menu items that the pricing cut will be applied to using menu engineering, one of the methods used in the restaurant industry to evaluate menu items performance. In the next phase, we forecast demand for the next period by modeling the effect of price on sales history. In the third phase, the demand model is substituted into the dynamic pricing model, which is then optimized by using non-linear programming method. The optimization result shows that the proposed model can increase restaurant revenue up to 28% compared to historical revenue.

Based on this circumstance, this work constructs a new metaheuristic called as migrating walrus algorithm (MWA) based on the hybridization of both MA and WaOA to create a better metaheuristic than them. MWA consists of five migrations: four directed migrations and one local migration. The references used in these directed migrations are the best walrus, a randomly picked better walrus, a randomly picked walrus, and two randomly picked walruses. In this work, two assessments are carried out: the comparative assessment and the individual migration assessment. The 23 functions are selected as theoretical use cases. In the comparative assessment, MWA is confronted with five new metaheuristics: MA, WaOA, attack leave optimization (ALO), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and osprey optimization algorithm (OOA). The result shows that MWA is better than ALO, COA, MA, OOA, and WaOA in 19, 19, 19, 17, and 17 functions. On the other hand, the individual migration assessment result indicates that the multiple migration approach is important to maintain the superiority of MWA with the directed migration toward the best walrus becoming the most important contributor.

The study aims to see the effects of additional attention mechanisms in the hybrid model CNN-BiLTSM with the resulting accuracy that the model gets. Furthermore, we also compare the CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model with attention to the BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM models. As a case study, this study used data on the electricity load in Bali, Indonesia. We also compare the experimental results to show that the CNN-BiLSTM with Attention model produces the best accuracy, with a root mean square error of 13.676 and a correlation coefficient 0.993 compared to the other two. These experiments have shown that improving predictions of electricity usage can be achieved by combining the original BiLSTM model with both a CNN layer and an attention mechanism.

RCO provides a distinct mechanism regarding the diversification-intensification strategy. Each member runs two sequential activities in every iteration. The first activity is running and the second one is catching. Each activity generates a seed. In the first activity, a virtual best member moves away from the corresponding member to become the first seed. The second seed is generated along the way between the corresponding member and the first seed in the first activity. If both seeds fail to improve, the member conducts a random search to find a new member. Otherwise, the better seed replaces the corresponding member. Then, RCO is challenged to handle both theoretical and real-world optimization problems. The classic 23 functions represent theoretical problems, while the outsourcing optimization problem represents the practical problem. In these simulations, RCO is confronted with five other algorithms: grey wolf optimizer (GWO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), marine predator algorithm (MPA), Komodo mlipir algorithm (KMA), and pelican optimization algorithm (POA). The result shows that RCO is better than POA, KMA, MPA, GWO and PSO in optimizing 20, 21, 13, 12, and 21 functions consecutively.

Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar has a feature for detecting the target location. However, estimating the small displacement in the bridge structure requires extensive bandwidth to reach the proper resolution.

In this study, a multidimensional sentiment analysis was conducted on tourist attractions in the provinces of DKI Jakarta, Banten, East Java, Central Java, and West Java. Data was collected between January and March 2023 using the Data Miner tool. Two labeling techniques, namely Transformer and Textblob, were compared for labeling the data. The confusion matrix was employed as the evaluation tool, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique was used to implement sentiment analysis. Labeling using transformers obtains an accuracy of 0.8169 or 81.6%, then the average precision, recall and f1-score are 68%, 54%, abd 58%. While labeling using textblob, obtained an accuracy of 0.9257 or 92.5%, the average precision is 88%, recall and f1-score results are 87%. The accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score results indicate that labeling using Textblob outperforms the labeling using Transformers.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

            "In Indonesia, the prevalence of osteoporosis is high. Given the economic burden it may impose on the population, this condition must be taken seriously. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is the gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis (DEXA). However, due to its high cost, non-portability, and radiation risk, DEXA cannot be applied to large populations. An alternative method for evaluating bone quality is ultrasound. It is more affordable, portable, and has no radiation risk. In this preliminary study, an A-mode ultrasound spectroscopy prototype for assessing the density of a 3D-printed bone model is designed. A single-element transducer (Transmit-Tx\/Receive-Rx), a reconfigurable and modular FPGA-based ultrasound beamformer system, and a Raspberry Pi 3 are the system's control units. The raw radio frequency (RF) signal is acquired from three variations of density of the 3D-printed bone model, i.e., 100%, 60%, and 40%, to represent normal bone, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. The designed prototype can adequately characterize the mechanical wave scattering pattern of the 3D-printed bone model indicated by the increased tendency in the maximum amplitude when the density of the bone model is increasing. The tendency is the opposite for delay time and Power Spectral Density (PSD). These three signal parameters are potential candidate parameters to represent bone density. For future work, the selected candidate parameters can later be used as reference values while adding a significant data so that a machine learning method can be employed to extract representative features of bone density level, i.e., normal bone, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. \u00a9 2023, North Atlantic University Union NAUN.

Design\/methodology\/approach: The study population was all members of \u201cSharia Property Developer\u201d (DPS) across Indonesia with criteria of having subordinates at least one person and is listed as a DPS member. The samples used were 71 people from the 200 members of DPS across Indonesia. The sampling method used was based on R2value and significance level with an 80% statistical strength. Data analysis was carried out using smartPLS software to test the relationship of change management, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and leadership style on employee performance. Findings: The utilization of SEM in Smart PLS for change management with the ADKAR method had a negative value of 6.2% in affecting employee performance and 4.6% in affecting job satisfaction. Job satisfaction insignificantly affected employee performance by 7.5%. Leadership style and organizational commitment positively affected performance by 57.9% and 25.6%, respectively. Research limitations\/implications: This study did not limit respondents\u2019 education levels. Twenty percent of respondents were middle and high school graduates. Respondent\u2019s position was mostly the highest leader in the company by 58%. Indicators in the ADKAR model did not implement the construct validity test since the researchers did not find precedent studies that discuss the indicators of the ADKAR model in detail. Practical implications: Factors that positively and significantly affected employee performance can be used to plan employee performance of DPS member companies. Social implications: The company must create a program to produce meaning in working, shape leaders to have discipline by putting appropriate employees as leaders. Originality\/value: This study used change management, organizational commitment, job satisfaction and leadership style as exogenous variables, job satisfaction and leadership style as intervening variables. The\u00a0study model modified the previous study regarding employee performance improvement because it utilized the change management with the ADKAR model. The study objects were sharia property companies, where the researchers did not find previous studies discussing employee performance in sharia property companies. \u00a9 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Research limitations\/implications: This study did not limit respondents\u2019 education levels. Twenty percent of respondents were middle and high school graduates. Respondent\u2019s position was mostly the highest leader in the company by 58%. Indicators in the ADKAR model did not implement the construct validity test since the researchers did not find precedent studies that discuss the indicators of the ADKAR model in detail. Practical implications: Factors that positively and significantly affected employee performance can be used to plan employee performance of DPS member companies. Social implications: The company must create a program to produce meaning in working, shape leaders to have discipline by putting appropriate employees as leaders. Originality\/value: This study used change management, organizational commitment, job satisfaction and leadership style as exogenous variables, job satisfaction and leadership style as intervening variables. The\u00a0study model modified the previous study regarding employee performance improvement because it utilized the change management with the ADKAR model. The study objects were sharia property companies, where the researchers did not find previous studies discussing employee performance in sharia property companies. \u00a9 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Later the data was monitored and controlled using an Android application which aims to compare the two types of networks. In this study, several tests were carried out, namely SNR, RSSI, delay, and packet loss. The test was carried out in the city of Bandung with different LoRa signal strength that could be seen on Telkom IoT web. Based on experiment, LoRaWAN class C has higher QoS performance for delay, SNR, RSSI, and packet loss than LoRaWAN class A for test location distance of 0, 1, 2, and 4 km away from BTS LoRa. According to the ITU-T G.1010 standard, the delay value produced in this experiment is in the \"Very good\" category, packet loss value is in the Very good \u201ccategory\u201d, and the RSSI value is in the \u201cEnough\u201d category. And the SNR value is in the recommended category of SF10. Also, it can be concluded that the redder LoRa coverage location map reveals, the better QoS value obtained.

Indonesia has a fracture injury prevalence of 5.5% with the distribution of injuries to the upper extremities 32.7% and 67.9% to the lower extremities. Treatment of bone fractures is generally done by radiological examination. X-ray is a tool that is commonly used to detect bone fractures because it is the easiest and fastest. However, the use of X-rays in the long term can cause radiation effects of ionizing radiation. Therefore, it is necessary to use alternative imaging methods. One method that can be considered for detecting fractures without causing radiation effects is bio-impedance. Basically, biological systems have both resistive and capacitive properties. If a voltage or electric current is injected with a frequency variation, an electrical impedance spectrum will be obtained which is a characteristic of biological tissue called Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The impedance spectrum is directly related to the properties of body tissues. This research was conducted using an EIS based on Analog Discovery, a phantom 3D Printed Model of femur made from Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) as a phantom of human femur bones with normal bone and bone fractures. Impedance measurements were carried out with a frequency variation range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz.

However, the performance of the system still needs to be improved.

Therefore, we propose a convolutional long short-term memory neural network (CNN\u2013LSTM) with grid search ability, which provides a robust blood-pressure estimation system by extracting meaningful information from PPG signals and reducing the complexity of hyperparameter optimization in the proposed model. The multiparameter intelligent monitoring for intensive care III (MIMIC III) dataset obtained PPG and arterial-blood-pressure (ABP) signals. We obtained 75,226 signal segments, with 60,180 signals allocated for training data, 12,030 signals allocated for the validation set, and 15,045 signals allocated for the test data. During training, we applied five-fold cross-validation with a grid-search method to select the best model and determine the optimal hyperparameter settings. The optimized configuration of the CNN\u2013LSTM layers consisted of five convolutional layers, one long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, and two fully connected layers for blood-pressure estimation. This study successfully achieved good accuracy in assessing both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by calculating the standard deviation (SD) and the mean absolute error (MAE), resulting in values of 7.89 \u00b1 3.79 and 5.34 \u00b1 2.89 mmHg, respectively.

            "When rotating a ball using a hand [Figs. 1(a) and (b)], the fingers that touch the ball's outer surface will exert frictional forces on the ball. These frictional forces cause torques on the ball so that the ball spins in the same direction as the finger's rotational direction. If the finger rotates clockwise, the ball's rotational direction will also be clockwise and vice versa. When the ball is cut into half, it is rotated similarly to when spinning a full ball. Thus, we can easily guess that its direction of rotation will be the same as when circling a full ball. What if the ball is spun differently? The half ball is spun using one fingertip from the bottom center of the inside, as shown in Figs. 1(c) and (d). What is the direction of rotation of the half ball? Would it be the same as when the ball is rotated from the outside? It turns out that the spin direction of the half ball is the opposite of the finger's spin direction. The same result was observed when using a pen or a stick to rotate the half ball from the center base [Fig. 1(d) and supplemental video. Finally, suppose we shift the finger's tip to any location so that it will no longer be at the center of the bottom of the object. In that case, the half ball's rotation direction is similar to the one of the finger or stick. Why does this happen? In this paper, the answer to this question is presented.  \u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

The demand for devices to handle oil remediation is increasing due to the frequent occurrence of oil spills. To date, numerous works have been reported to address this pollution problem, but most of them do not utilize Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Having an IoT system of this kind would improve operational efficiency by providing real-time data, alerts, and notifications of oil pollution through monitoring systems. This study presents the development of an IoT-based automatic oil-water separator device to support an oil pollution monitoring system in water ecosystems. The built device consists of sensors, a microcontroller, and an actuator, with the capability to automatically detect oil pollution and perform water-oil separation. The device incorporates a monitoring system. The water-oil separation was carried out by applying semi-permeable membrane nanotechnology. Moreover, the device has undergone a series of oily-water separation experiments to simulate oil pollution, achieving an oil separation efficiency of 62.8% (on average) with good repeatability. Additionally, the automatic device is developed with IoT pairing with a website application for an online monitoring system. Users can monitor the process using a personal computer or smartphone via the web\/mobile application at any time and from any place.

However, there are still elderly people who take medication irregularly because their memory is starting to weaken. Early signs experienced by the elderly who suffer from memory skills are forgetting about information that has just been obtained or learned and often having difficulty completing daily work routines, so it is necessary to develop a research on products that help the elderly in carrying out regular drug-taking activities without need help from people to remind them. In this research, the design thinking method was used, namely identifying the wants and needs of 20 elderly people while taking medication and identifying them according to the first stage of design thinking empathy, through interviews and direct observation at the Guido Valadares Hospital in Timor-Leste. After the first stage, the author enters the second stage, which is define to describe the user's view which will be the basis of the product to be made. With the first and second stages already, the author will enter the third stage, namely ideate to describe the required solution. This study aims to describe each stage of design thinking in the design of reminder aids for the elderly in an effort to create appropriate and effective solutions to the problems faced by patients at Guido Valadares Hospital Timor-Leste. This study uses a qualitative approach with descriptive analysis. The result of this study is that with a good design thinking process, this research has resulted in a solution for patients in the hospital by designing an image of a proposed reminder tool that helps patients take medication regularly. The implementation of the design thinking stage that was carried out was not optimal due to material constraints so that it did not reach the prototype and test stages for users, and the author only used three stages of design thinking (empathy, define, and ideate), without reaching the prototype and test stages does not affect the results of the identification using the design thinking method. In designing a reminder tool, it is hoped that it can help patients at the hospital to take medication on time and can check heart rate and oxygen levels in the body when needed, the product is expected to be easy to use so that users can use it easily. Reminder tools can assist users with audible alarm sounds for reminders. The reminder aid product also has a large screen so that users can see the time easily and can see the results of checking heart rate and oxygen levels and the results of subsequent alarms.

            "With the rapid advancement of information technology, the demand for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has significantly increased. In response to this, Telkom University introduced the My TelU application to enhance the quality of learning services more efficiently. It is crucial to continuously maintain and improve the service quality of the application to meet user expectations effectively. This research utilizes two methods, namely the Electronic Service Quality and Importance Performance Analysis (IPA). The Electronic Service Quality method is employed to assess the gap between user expectations and their perceptions, as well as to measure the level of service quality. Additionally, the Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) method is used to identify the attributes that significantly influence user expectations and prioritize improvements accordingly, by focusing on attributes that play a vital role. The study reveals that the average gap between user expectations and application performance is-0.95. Moreover, the average value of service quality, obtained by dividing the value of user expectations by the application performance, is 0.78. Based on this average service quality value, it can be concluded that the services provided by the My Tel-U application are below satisfactory levels, as the average value is less than 1. The attributes requiring priority improvements, categorized in Quadrant A, include X11, X13, X20, and X25.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

            "Named Data Networking (NDN) is a future Internet network architecture design under development, which changes the host-centric to the content-centric network model. Researchers have developed NDN-based networks in recent years in an attempt to overcome the limitations of the TCP\/IP architecture. Named data networks using content names involve many things, including routing. Although NDN has a routing protocol, the current problem is that it has high overhead because the routing used by NDN is currently decentralized, where each synchronization and path update process uses broadcast packet delivery. To reduce broadcasts and reduce the overhead of creating a controller where the controller has a separate signaling path from the data path. How to combine NDN with centralized control and design the overall architecture to achieve good performance and overhead has been done by many previous researchers. However, the development process still relies heavily on IP. So in this paper, we propose an NDN Centralized Routing that runs on top of NDN. It only forwards packets of named packets by eliminating the IP of routers to communicate. This paper also compares the Centralized Routing system and the Decentralized Routing system. As a result, the overhead generated by centralized routing is lower when compared to decentralized routing.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.",

Therefore, we developed Smart RoamLingo app to help writing meaningful content in authentic contexts with sample sentences based on texts generated by recognition technologies named as AI-Sample Sentences (AI-SS) and writing qualities with revision suggestions based on personal original writings named as AI-Writing Feedback (AI-WF). 104 undergraduate students were assigned into an experimental group (EG) and two control groups. EG significantly outperformed the other groups in the post-test. In EG, AI-SS can help the contextualization to produce comprehensive content actively while AI-WF can help the personalization to improve the writing quality through several revisions. Hence, the cohesion and consistency of their writing can be enhanced. Further, the total number of revisions in practices and the assignment score can significantly predict the post-test.

Users find it easier to express their needs in terms of the functional aspects of a product rather than its technical features. To address this issue, we propose a conversational recommender system (CRS) to assist in interacting with users in order to elicit user need preferences.

The evaluation of this system focuses on two main parameters: system performance and user satisfaction.

E-wallets, which can also be called electronic money, is one of the application of the increasing development of the internet. One of the activities of using the internet is Electronic Money transactions through digital wallets (e-wallets). In 2020, bank bjb launched its e-wallet service, Digicash, entering the industry. However, Digicash has observed relatively low user numbers and transactions compared to its competitors like Gopay and OVO. This research aims to analyze the factors that influences user's intention of contiuing the use of Digicash application to adress the issue. The theoretical approach employed is the UTAUT 2 model, developed by Venkatesh, Thong, and Xu in 2012. Additionally, this study incorporates additional factors such as Price Saving Orientation, Trust, Perceived Security, and Perceived Privacy to modify the UTAUT2 model. Data collection involved distributing online questionnaires via Google Forms to 464 respondents residing in Indonesia. The questionnaire consisted of 32 questions from 8 constructs. The data analysis technique employed in this study is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with SmartPLS 4 Software.The results indicate that the factors influencing the continuance intention to use Digicash, ranked from highest to lowest, are Social Influence, Price Saving Orientation, Perceived Risk, Hedonic Motivation, Habit, and Performance Expectancy. The model's category is considered 'good' as it can predict the continuance intention of consumers towards Digicash services in Indonesia with an R2 value of 56%. Moreover, the Age variable is moderated by Habit.

The study utilizes the Household Expenditure and Income Survey conducted in 2019 by the Department of Statistics of Malaysia, which included a simple random sample of 4,730 households. A simultaneous equations model is the employed method of analysis, and the results reveal that the gender of the household head, residential areas, and income groups have differential effects on household consumption and indebtedness through predetermined variables. Specifically, results show that indebtedness has a negative effect on household consumption for the middle-income group (M40); savings are negatively associated with consumption for households living in rural areas and the M40 group. Furthermore, income is positively associated with consumption for rural households and when the household head is female.

To address this pressing issue, the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as a transformative technological solution. IoT enables the interconnection of electronic devices to the internet, granting accessibility from anywhere and at any time. In response to this problem, an innovative IoT-based prototype has been developed to monitor and predict lake water levels. This prototype utilizes a linear regression approach as a reliable method for water level prediction. Furthermore, it leverages the LoRa network to ensure data accessibility even in areas without internet connectivity, and it operates sustainably by harnessing solar panels as an energy source. These unique features make the prototype a groundbreaking solution, revolutionizing the way we manage and safeguard our lakes. The efficacy of the prototype is proven by the remarkable accuracy of error testing (error) on the predicted linear regression values using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), yielding an impressively low error rate of below 10%. Such high accuracy validates the reliability and effectiveness of the system, giving stakeholders the confidence to adopt and implement this solution on a broader scale.

RCO provides a distinct mechanism regarding the diversification-intensification strategy. Each member runs two sequential activities in every iteration. The first activity is running and the second one is catching. Each activity generates a seed. In the first activity, a virtual best member moves away from the corresponding member to become the first seed. The second seed is generated along the way between the corresponding member and the first seed in the first activity. If both seeds fail to improve, the member conducts a random search to find a new member. Otherwise, the better seed replaces the corresponding member. Then, RCO is challenged to handle both theoretical and real-world optimization problems.

The local government has placed garbage bins in public spaces but people sometimes still throw out the garbage that doesnot fit the type. Disposing of garbage in the same place is considered to be difficult for garbage menagement because each type of garbage has a different time to decompose. It is necessary to classify garbage based on its basic ingredients so that garbage management becomes better and easier. Organic garbage can be used for fertilizer while non-organic garbage can be recycled. This research proposes to build a classifier that is able to distinguish the types of garbage. Transfer learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Network architecture is implemented in this research. Two pre-trained models are implemented-VGG16 and MobileNet, to train thousands of images from 12 types of garbage which are Battery, Biological, Brown-Glass, Cardboard, Clothes, Green-Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Shoes, Trash and White-Glass. Based on the experimental results, the accuracy of the VGG16 architecture reaches 86% and the accuracy of the MobileNet architecture reaches 85%. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).",

Image-based assessment using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging has particular promise for non-invasive full-field mapping of cerebrovascular hemodynamics. However, estimations are complicated by the narrow and tortuous intracranial vasculature, with accurate image-based quantification directly dependent on sufficient spatial resolution. Further, extended scan times are required for high-resolution acquisitions, and most clinical acquisitions are performed at comparably low resolution (>1 mm) where biases have been observed with regard to the quantification of both flow and relative pressure. The aim of our study was to develop an approach for quantitative intracranial super-resolution 4D Flow MRI, with effective resolution enhancement achieved by a dedicated deep residual network, and with accurate quantification of functional relative pressures achieved by subsequent physics-informed image processing. To achieve this, our two-step approach was trained and validated in a patient-specific in-silico cohort, showing good accuracy in estimating velocity (relative error: 15.0 \u00b1 0.1%, mean absolute error (MAE): 0.07 \u00b1 0.06 m\/s, and cosine similarity: 0.99 \u00b1 0.06 at peak velocity) and flow (relative error: 6.6 \u00b1 4.7%, root mean square error (RMSE): 0.56 mL\/s at peak flow), and with the coupled physics-informed image analysis allowing for maintained recovery of functional relative pressure throughout the circle of Willis (relative error: 11.0 \u00b1 7.3%, RMSE: 0.3 \u00b1 0.2 mmHg).

We validated the proposed system using Xethru X4M03 that is connected to a series of computer simulations and we also categorized the target in many positions i.e., sleeping position, slightly holding breath, minor body movements, and exercise. The result shows that before filtering it has an error of 1.2 and after filtering it becomes 0.9. In the state of breathing accompanied by holding your breath, the error value generated before filtering is 45.02 and after filtering is 15.99.

            "In Indonesia, fiscal decentralisation has been implemented for two decades, and it is expected that the regions will have a sufficient level of independence to increase economic growth and welfare. This study investigates the influence of fiscal decentralisation and human development on regional economic growth. The sample data comprised 484 county-level in Indonesia and utilised the panel data method. The findings showed that the central government grant, locally generated revenue, and human capital development positively influenced regional economic growth, although the degree of decentralisation negatively affected regional growth. Meanwhile, for regions with independence above 50 per cent, decentralisation, locally generated revenue, central government transfer and provincial loans and human capital development positively influenced regional economic growth. In addition, findings also indicated that a dynamic effect exists, implying that the performance of previous regional economic growth influenced current economic achievements. The policy implication of the study is that policymakers cannot equalise policy to boost regional economic growth because every county has its specific characteristics. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "In Indonesia, fiscal decentralisation has been implemented for two decades, and it is expected that the regions will have a sufficient level of independence to increase economic growth and welfare. This study investigates the influence of fiscal decentralisation and human development on regional economic growth. The sample data comprised 484 county-level in Indonesia and utilised the panel data method. The findings showed that the central government grant, locally generated revenue, and human capital development positively influenced regional economic growth, although the degree of decentralisation negatively affected regional growth. Meanwhile, for regions with independence above 50 per cent, decentralisation, locally generated revenue, central government transfer and provincial loans and human capital development positively influenced regional economic growth. In addition, findings also indicated that a dynamic effect exists, implying that the performance of previous regional economic growth influenced current economic achievements. The policy implication of the study is that policymakers cannot equalise policy to boost regional economic growth because every county has its specific characteristics. \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In 2019, the coordinating minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment of the Republic of Indonesia, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, stated that it is a top priority in the national agenda to keep improving solid waste management due to the growing number of people living in the urban areas and the estimated 105.000 tons of solid waste a day. This paper aims to create an IT blueprint for this waste management through a distributed system that allows an optimum flow of waste out of dense urban centers and into the proper waste disposal facilities. It involves smarter waste surveillance, a consolidated fleet of collection agents of varying mobility and capacity and includes people participation to control unnecessary waste generation. The system should be scalable while using existing resources and systems to manage the problem in the long term. It should maintain the three principles of Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM): waste prevention, recycling, and disposal.
