            "Studies have shown that digital transformation has a positive impact on business performance, yet more than 80% of implementations fail due to organizations failing to understand its true nature as a business transformation. Existing references to digital transformation do not clearly differentiate it from digitalization or technology adoption, and existing models and frameworks are often abstract, making it difficult for organizations to find practical implementation guidelines. This paper utilizes a systematic literature review to identify the unique characteristics of successful digital transformation adoption and proposes an extended framework for its implementation. The result of the review leads to the conclusion that three key characteristics of successful digital transformation are business capabilities transformation, data management capabilities transformation, and IT roles transformation. Additionally, the paper provides a practical step-by-step framework and a summary of good practices related to the implementation of digital transformation. The contributions of this paper are that it explicitly defines the unique characteristics for successful digital transformation implementation and provides an extended step-by-step framework. Both practically and theoretically, this paper serves as a guide for organizations in implementing digital transformation. \u00a9 2023, Success Culture Press. All rights reserved."

            "Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network (DMVPN) is a combination of mGRE, NHRP and IPsec Encryption technologies that can maintain network security in companies, especially aspects of confidentiality, data integrity and authentication. However, companies also require a consistently available network to ensure uninterrupted business processes, so First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) can be used as a solution for the availability aspect of the network. In previous research, the implementation of the DMVPN network used one of the FHRP protocols, namely HSRP, so this research was conducted to test the DMVPN network using other FHRP protocols, namely VRRP and GLBP using a star topology with a variation of Dual HUB to test network redundancy using evaluation metrics of network convergence time and Quality of Service (QoS) in the form of throughput, delay and packet loss. The results of QoS testing on sending TCP packets using GLBP on the DMVPN network are better based on throughput, delay, and packet loss. This is due to the load-balancing feature in GLBP. However, in UDP packet transmission, it was found that the use of VRRP on the DMVPN network was better than using GLBP based on the results of throughput, delay, packet loss and network convergence time. This happens because the load-balancing feature on GLBP does not work on UDP packet transmission and network convergence time when the primary router has a problem, VRRP is faster with 3.58 seconds compared to GLBP which takes 9.56 seconds.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

In the current digitalization era, various organizations are focusing on increasing the quantity of Information Technology (IT) assets to support business processes, including organizations engaged in the education sector. However, the impact arising from IT equipment has not been well thought out and managed. The same thing also happened to the Bandung Institute of Technology, which had no concerns regarding IT equipment emissions. In reality, the management of IT equipment has not been carried out properly due to the absence of an equipment management system based on environmental aspects, such as greenhouse gas emissions and end-of-life period. Therefore, this research focuses on developing a method with a design thinking approach to develop an IT equipment management system. Design thinking is used as a method of development approach so that it can be adapted to the needs of users and organizations. This method is expected to provide insight to ITB stakeholders so that they are able to design an environment-based IT equipment management system. \u00a9 2023 Copyright held by the owner\/author(s).

There are severe data network congestion problems in metropolitan areas, particularly Jakarta, Indonesia\u2019s capital city. Urgent action is required to address infrastructure and capacity limitations and maintain reliable connectivity. Carrier aggregation (CA) may alleviate bottlenecks by giving users higher bandwidth, throughput, and data rates. This research examined the techno-economic aspects of using 2.1 GHz CA versus non-CA in an urban region of North Jakarta. CA required fewer eNodeB and performed better on key performance indicators like received signal power, signal-to-noise ratio, and throughput. Cellular operators also saw faster investment returns with CA. CA\u2019s performance and economic benefits make it a promising solution for Indonesia\u2019s 4G network congestion. \u00a9 2023 Muhammad Imam Nashiruddin et al; published by UIKTEN.

The efficiency of various filters, including the Classic Bloom filter, Partitioned Bloom filter, Counting Bloom filter, Cuckoo filter, and Xor filter, are compared in terms of their computing time, cost, and resource usage for both write and read operations. The findings show that while the use of filters led to a slight increase in insertion and query time for existing keys in the database, it also resulted in a significant decrease in query time for nonexistent keys. The Cuckoo filter was found to be the most efficient. This research provides valuable insights for IT MSMEs and startups in Indonesia, enabling them to make informed decisions in optimizing their database systems through filter selection.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

Research about forest fire prediction and its impact has been abundant. However, there still needs to be more people's awareness of the hazard and risks. This study introduces an interactive simulation tool to help society and scientists from other fields understand better the risk of climate-related fire in Borneo. The interactive simulator of forest fire prediction is created as a web-based application using the Flask framework and Bokeh library in Python. As the first development, it visualizes the historical spatial and temporal forest and land fire data over Borneo, computed by machine learning methods, namely Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machine. The prediction results show that the three models similarly predict burned areas. Meanwhile, Random Forest predicts the carbon emission slightly better than other models, with 4.751 and 0.008 for MAE and NRMSE, respectively. It also gives interactive features that the user can play to estimate the fires, given climate and environmental conditions.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

            "In Indonesia, the leather industry product is an export commodity that is consistently growing with each passing year. The increasing demands of organic leather-based product in the global market drives up the number of potential market opportunity for companies in the leather industry sector. Among the fundamental requirements of involvement eligibility in said market is to possess an internationally recognized certification concerning Environmental Management System (EMS). Aside of being a prerequisite, the implementation of an EMS points towards the long term objective of company & supply chain sustainability development. The scope of a robust EMS includes Asset Recovery (AR) element process that helps company achieve optimal environmental performance and efficient resource usage. In the sustainability endeavor, environmental friendliness performance and continuous monitoring evaluation must be fulfilled, and in the context of this study, ISO14001:2015 EMS standardization is used as basis of reference. Furthermore, risk managements also need to be conducted in order for a system to be able to continuously develop & improve. To be able to effectively analyze the current AR business process for the purpose of activities mapping & risks identification, the SCOR model is utilized. Identified risks are then validated by the company and processed using the CRITIC method. Lastly, preventive action alternatives formulated from the identified risks are processed using the TOPSIS method. The processed data was refined in the form of Neutrosophic Set to be able to represent real-world condition. The results show the weight priority of each risks and the ranking of preventive action alternatives, which are then used as input data and presented in the form of a risk mitigation monitoring system.  \u00a9 2023 Author(s)."
