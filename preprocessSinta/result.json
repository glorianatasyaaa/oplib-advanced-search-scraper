            "Tea is a widely consumed beverage globally, significantly impacting taste, aroma, and consumer satisfaction. Traditional methods of assessing tea quality rely on subjective sensory evaluation by expert panels, which can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to biases. In recent years, electronic nose (e-nose) technology has emerged as a promising and objective approach to tea quality assessment. This study investigates the application of e-nose technology for the automated and objective assessment of Gambung green tea quality, especially for noninfused (dry) tea aroma. Using noninfused tea has advantages because it does not require a long preparation procedure such as brewing and does not damage the tea sample, so it can be used repeatedly. However, this also has its challenges due to the less strong tea aroma making it more difficult to identify. Machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) were utilized to evaluate their performance in classification and regression tasks. The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm achieved the highest accuracy and provided reliable confusion matrix results. Moreover, the k-NN algorithm outperformed other approaches in predicting organoleptic scores, with the highest R-squared score and the lowest mean squared error values. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of e-nose technology coupled with optimized machine learning algorithms for the noninfused aroma-based identification of Gambung green tea. However, improvements are required to enhance the performance of organoleptic score predictions. This study contributes to the understanding and application of e-nose technology in tea quality assessment, opening ways for further progress in this area.  \u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.",

The parameters mentioned above are critical for assessing the air quality conditions and concentration of air pollutants. Outdoor air pollution concentration variations before and after the Emergency CARE, which was held in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic on July 3-21, 2021, were studied. An air quality monitoring system based on the IoT generates sensor data that is collected from a government-integrated data portal, and that can be analyzed statistically. There are two main types of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): one-way (or unidirectional) and two-way, which are applied to the collected sensor data and hypotheses calculated using ANOVA. ANOVA one-way was found to be more effective for analyzing air quality condition data. During emergency CARE, the average concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and O3 from the air quality monitoring system show values that have exceeded the standard Air Quality Index (AQI), while the concentrations of CO, NO2, and SO2are still below the applicable AQI values.

However, whilst there were difficulties from the Covid-19 pandemic, it also resulted in a unique opportunity to implement digital transformation of the education system by bringing about positive change. As a consequence educators and students are required to be able to quickly adapt to changes in the online learning system, and educational institutions must invest and update infrastructure by developing online learning platforms that facilitate the teaching and learning process. Using the lens of Lewin's change model, this study aims to explore the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on educational practices, educator perspectives and key determinants of readiness behavior in universities. This study uses a qualitative method by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who are educators in private universities in Indonesia. This study found that most educators experienced problems during online learning practices, and they realized that these changes in educational practices would continue in the post-Covid era. We also identify two key determinants of behavioural readiness for dealing with change: adaptability and engagement initiative, and innovation in educational practice that helps to understand the digitalization process caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Design\/methodology\/approach: This is a quantitative method research project conducted through a survey of SMEs in Semarang, Central Java, from February to June 2021. SMEs that have been operated to sustainable business were chosen purposively as samples. Based on the requirement, there are 220 entities used in this study. Data analysis was conducted by using Structural Equation Model. Findings: The results of this study provide empirical support that the factors studied affect the acceptance of SME business actors toward the implementation of SBMI. The application of this SBMI is used to design and implement a sustainable business model for SME businesses. This study has identified, explained and empirically supported the behavioral structures (composites and factors) that influence the adoption of SBMIs that are commonly available for business modeling. Research limitations\/implications: The main limitation of this research is the static view of the structure (construction) that influences the use or application of SBMI by SME actors which often changes over time, experience and failure. Originality\/value: This study supports the execution of sustainable innovation initiatives that have yet to be investigated at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. This is especially true when beginning a firm, because entrepreneurs encounter uncertainty while putting their plans into action at one of three levels: strategic, operational or tactical. \u00a9 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

This paper presents the experimentations on PHP contrived using copper with different inner tube diameters of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm, respectively. The PHP is accused of acetone as a functional liquid with filling proportions varying from 50 to 90% of its volume with an increment of 10%. The effects of filling proportion and tube diameter on the thermal performance of PHP were investigated. The evaporator zone is electrically heated using a mica heater in the range of 20\u201380 W, and the condenser area is kept cool by the water circulation method. The results show that a 2 mm inner tube diameter performs best compared to other tube diameters, with a lower rate of thermal resistance of 0.49 K\/W. Also, the performance of PHP is enhanced at a filling proportion of 60% for all the tube diameters. Further, CFD analysis was carried out for different filling ratios for a 2 mm diameter pipe at a constant heat input of 80 W, and it revealed that test outcomes were in line with CFD results. The deviation between the experimental and numerical studies was 10%. Considering the optimized parameters, i.e., tube diameter and filling ratio, the work was extended by adding SiO2nanoparticles to the base fluid with 1\u20135 % mass concentration. The results showed a lower thermal resistance value of 0.3 W\/K and a higher heat transfer coefficient of 828.64 W\/m2\u00b0K was obtained at 2% mass concentration of SiO2. Also, the proportional rise in heat transfer coefficient at 60 W is 11.46, 17, 14, 4.15, and 1.94% for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% mass concentration of SiO2nanoparticles, respectively.

This study also analyzes the obstacles in implementing the LS framework as incubation metrics. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study uses mixed methods. Quantitative research using multiple linear regression was applied to the data of 30 start-ups incubated at Bandung Techno Park for the 2014\u20132017 period and survival tracking data after the incubation. A qualitative approach to complete the explanatory work was conducted through in-depth interviews with 12 respondents, including start-up graduates from the incubation program, program managers and mentors. Findings: This study confirms that several LS incubation metrics significantly affect start-up sustainability after incubation. In addition, this study also explains several problems in applying the LS discipline that needs attention to increase incubation success. Research limitations\/implications: Research was conducted only at one technology business incubator (TBI) model that focuses on digital start-ups in the emerging ecosystem. Research results can be biased in different situations and ecosystems. Practical implications: The explanation of the relationship of LS-based incubation metrics to the survival of start-ups, as well as the challenges of their implementation, can be a reference for TBI management to consider and prioritize intervention strategies, thereby improving TBI\u2019s business processes and increasing the success rate of incubated start-ups. Social implications: The creation of university start-ups and spin-offs has become a key performance indicator mandatory for technology universities in Indonesia. The existence of TBI institutions in universities as channels of technology commercialization is essential. The incubator\u2019s success in creating a new technology-based company will have a significant social impact on the surrounding environment.

The parameters mentioned above are critical for assessing the air quality conditions and concentration of air pollutants. Outdoor air pollution concentration variations before and after the Emergency CARE, which was held in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic on July 3-21, 2021, were studied.

However, whilst there were difficulties from the Covid-19 pandemic, it also resulted in a unique opportunity to implement digital transformation of the education system by bringing about positive change. As a consequence educators and students are required to be able to quickly adapt to changes in the online learning system, and educational institutions must invest and update infrastructure by developing online learning platforms that facilitate the teaching and learning process. Using the lens of Lewin's change model, this study aims to explore the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on educational practices, educator perspectives and key determinants of readiness behavior in universities. This study uses a qualitative method by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who are educators in private universities in Indonesia. This study found that most educators experienced problems during online learning practices, and they realized that these changes in educational practices would continue in the post-Covid era. We also identify two key determinants of behavioural readiness for dealing with change: adaptability and engagement initiative, and innovation in educational practice that helps to understand the digitalization process caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

This paper presents the experimentations on PHP contrived using copper with different inner tube diameters of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm, respectively. The PHP is accused of acetone as a functional liquid with filling proportions varying from 50 to 90% of its volume with an increment of 10%. The effects of filling proportion and tube diameter on the thermal performance of PHP were investigated. The evaporator zone is electrically heated using a mica heater in the range of 20\u201380 W, and the condenser area is kept cool by the water circulation method. The results show that a 2 mm inner tube diameter performs best compared to other tube diameters, with a lower rate of thermal resistance of 0.49 K\/W. Also, the performance of PHP is enhanced at a filling proportion of 60% for all the tube diameters. Further, CFD analysis was carried out for different filling ratios for a 2 mm diameter pipe at a constant heat input of 80 W, and it revealed that test outcomes were in line with CFD results.

Considering the optimized parameters, i.e., tube diameter and filling ratio, the work was extended by adding SiO2nanoparticles to the base fluid with 1\u20135 % mass concentration.

            "Pulsating heat pipe (PHP) is an implicit technique through a passive two-stage heat transfer system. This paper presents the experimentations on PHP contrived using copper with different inner tube diameters of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm, respectively. The PHP is accused of acetone as a functional liquid with filling proportions varying from 50 to 90% of its volume with an increment of 10%. The effects of filling proportion and tube diameter on the thermal performance of PHP were investigated. The evaporator zone is electrically heated using a mica heater in the range of 20\u201380 W, and the condenser area is kept cool by the water circulation method. The results show that a 2 mm inner tube diameter performs best compared to other tube diameters, with a lower rate of thermal resistance of 0.49 K\/W. Also, the performance of PHP is enhanced at a filling proportion of 60% for all the tube diameters. Further, CFD analysis was carried out for different filling ratios for a 2 mm diameter pipe at a constant heat input of 80 W, and it revealed that test outcomes were in line with CFD results. The deviation between the experimental and numerical studies was 10%. Considering the optimized parameters, i.e., tube diameter and filling ratio, the work was extended by adding SiO2nanoparticles to the base fluid with 1\u20135 % mass concentration.

However, maintaining the temperature is a challenge in the drying process. Because it can influence the drying performance and produce a low-efficiency reduction of water content, in this study, the hybrid drying system is proposed to improve the performance of the forced convection dryer system. The proposed system used a proportional integral and derivative (PID) control system to obtain the optimal temperature. The proposed system was compared with natural drying and forced convection methods. The experimental result showed that the proposed system performed excellently for three performance evaluations. The average temperature was obtained as the highest of the other methods, with 54.68 \u00b0C and 54.55 \u00b0C for coffee and cocoa beans. The water content can be reduced by an average of 27.38% and 42.67% for coffee and cocoa beans.

The current method for RNA aptamer identification in vitro uses the SELEX method, which is considered inefficient due to its complex process. Computational models of aptamers have been used to predict and study the molecular interaction of modified aptamers to improve affinity. In this study, we generated three-dimensional models of five RNA aptamers from their sequence using mFold, RNAComposer web server, and molecular dynamics simulation. The model structures were then evaluated and compared with the experimentally determined structures.

However, such a process does not always provide straightforward information to make a complete interpretation. The segmentation process only identifies the region of cardiac septal abnormality, whereas complete interpretation should determine based on the position of defect.

            "This paper introduced a novel metaheuristic that is developed based on the tournament mechanism, namely quad tournament optimizer (QTO). As its name suggests, QTO proposes a new approach of metaheuristic in which there are four searches conducted by each agent in every iteration. These searches are: (1) searching toward the global best solution, (2) searching toward the middle between the global best solution and a randomly selected solution, (3) searching relative to a randomly selected solution, and (4) neighbourhood search around the corresponding solution and the global best solution. A solution candidate is generated by each search. Then, a tournament is carried out to find the best candidate. This strategy is novel because most of metaheuristic deploys only single search or multiple searches where each search is conducted sequentially. QTO is challenged to find the optimal solution of 23 classic functions. In this challenge, QTO is benchmarked against five shortcoming metaheuristics: marine predator algorithm (MPA), slime mould algorithm (SMA), golden search optimizer (GSO), hybrid pelican Komodo algorithm (HPKA), and guided pelican algorithm (GPA). The result indicates that QTO outperforms all these benchmark metaheuristics. QTO is better than MPA, SMA, GSO, HPKA, and GPA in solving 22, 19, 21, 20, and 13 functions consecutively. The result also indicates that QTO has successfully found the global optimal solution for nine functions: Sphere, Schwefel 2.22, Schwefel 1.2, Schwefel 2.21, Rastrigin, Griewank, Six Hump Camel, Branin, and Goldstein-Price. \u00a9 2023,International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.All Rights Reserved.",

This condition encourages humans to develop renewable energy sources, one of which is bioethanol, with the availability of abundant raw materials in nature. However, the development of bioethanol is still ineffective because it requires a long time and has high costs. Therefore, a design for bioethanol fabrication from oil palm plantation products with ionic liquid pretreatment using SuperPro Designer (SPD) software was developed. The bioethanol production process was simulated through three stages: pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification, and fermentation. Pretreatment was carried out using the ionic liquid Choline Acetate, after which the results of saccharification and fermentation were analyzed. The results of saccharification showed that around 138 g\/L of palm oil was converted into sugar for fermentation. The overall result of the simulation system is that the fermentation process for 12 hours produced 92 g\/L ethanol or 96% of the theoretical yield. Meanwhile, ethanol production through fabrication for energy can reduce ethanol prices by 30% from their initial price. This ethanol fabrication design is very supportive of optimizing biomass into bioethanol. Therefore, this design can be used as a recommendation for economical bioethanol production to obtain optimal results in bioethanol production. \u00a9 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In this study, we propose to investigate object detection for underwater surveillance cameras as a means of real-time monitoring and counting of lobsters. Underwater video data is fed into the proposed system based on a deep learning-based model. This system consists of three processes: image enhancement with WaterNet as noise reduction, object counting with the YOLOv6\/7\/8 model, and object tracking using StrongSORT. For details, we annotated the lobster data by head only and full body. Our test results show that YOLOv7, with head annotation, has stable mean Average Precision (mAP), making it suitable for the proposed system.

One of the tools to help neurologists diagnose epilepsy relies on EEG signals extensively because it can represent the brain's neuron activity. Due to the EEG signal being considered a complex biological signal, the signal complexity-based feature extraction method is suitable for characterizing epileptic EEG signals. One method for extracting EEG signals is entropy which is able to quantify signal complexity. Several previously proposed methods were wavelet entropy and IMF entropy. This study proposed multi-distance signal level difference (MSLD) entropy as a feature extraction method to extract the EEG signal complexity. The decomposed signal from MSLD was then extracted using entropy measurement. In the classification process, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to classify the normal, pre-ictal, and ictal signals of EEG signals. The highest accuracy of 96% was obtained using cubic SVM as the classifier. The proposed method provides an alternative method for analyzing EEG or other biomedical signals based on signal complexity. \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

This work presents a new metaheuristic: extended stochastic coati optimizer (ESCO). ESCO is developed by expanding the shortcoming coati optimization algorithm (COA). ESCO expands the number of searches and references used in COA. ESCO also implements a stochastic process for each unit to choose the searches that will perform. It differs from COA, which splits the population into two fixed groups, each performing its strategy. ESCO implements three sequential phases in every iteration. Two options can be chosen in every phase. ESCO has three references in its guided search: the global best unit, a randomly selected unit, and a randomized unit within the search space. In this work, ESCO is challenged to solve 23 classic functions and benchmarked with five shortcoming metaheuristics: guided pelican algorithm (GPA), puzzle optimization algorithm (POA), average subtraction-based optimizer (ASBO), and coati optimization algorithm (COA). The result presents the superiority of ESCO among five shortcoming metaheuristics by outperforming the GPA, POA, GSO, ASBO, and COA in solving 13, 21, 23, 16, and 13 functions, respectively.
