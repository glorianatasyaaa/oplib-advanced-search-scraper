      "For having quite complex parameters for each human, gait in each individual becomes different. This characteristic that can distinguish the gait of each individual is used in the field of biometrics to identify the gait of the individual being monitored. This research aims to analyze a person's gait using the Kinect V2. The implementation of gait analysis was monitored by placing the Kinect V2 2.5 m next to the path of a person walking on a treadmill. We recorded subject walking using the Kinect V2 and the Kinect Software Development Kit (SDK) and produced skeleton tracking data. The data were then processed, including feature extraction using first-order statistics and data classification using K-Nearest Neighbors with the N-fold Cross Validation feature. The data classified in this study produced an accuracy of 60% -94% using the lower part joint of the human body. The results of this study indicate that the use of the lower body limb joint is sufficient to be used as a gait biometric with a simple method. The use of more advanced techniques will certainly guarantee higher accuracy. \u00a9 2023 IEEE."

YOLOv4 models are the most balanced deep learning models in detecting left and right feet from footprint images. In different object detection models, the right foot showed higher accuracy than the left foot. People with cerebral palsy (CP) suffer primarily from lower-limb impairments. These impairments contribute to the abnormal performance of functional activities and ambulation. Footprints, such as plantar pressure images, are usually used to assess functional performance in people with spastic CP. Detecting left and right feet based on footprints in people with CP is a challenge due to abnormal foot progression angle and abnormal footprint patterns. Identifying left and right foot profiles in people with CP is essential to provide information on the foot orthosis, walking problems, index gait patterns, and determination of the dominant limb. Deep learning with object detection can localize and classify the object more precisely on the abnormal foot progression angle and complex footprints associated with spastic CP. This study proposes a new object detection model to auto-determine left and right footprints. The footprint images successfully represented the left and right feet with high accuracy in object detection. YOLOv4 more successfully detected the left and right feet using footprint images compared to other object detection models. YOLOv4 reached over 99.00% in various metric performances.

      "Mobile Cognitive Radio Base Station (MCRBS) is a technology to recover network communication temporarily in disaster areas. The communications can be built by constructing the backbone network, where it is formed by connecting multiple MCRBSs with point-to-point radio communication link considering the best routing algorithm. The MCRBS antenna system should has an ability on producing the beam into specific d irection to establish point-to-point radio communication link. However, there is no capable system to support the MCRBS antenna system for directing the beam. Therefore, it requires a system that can assist in focusing the beam of antenna system for the MCRBSs connectivity. In this paper, we propose Rotman Lens that has beamforming capability to support radio backbone communication for multiple MCRBSs connectivity in post-disaster networks. The Rotman Lens is chosen to generate amplitude and phase shift in performing beamforming technique with simultaneous signal transmissions from MCRBS to others without moving the antenna system. In this research, the Rotman Lens was evaluated through a series of computer simulations and laboratory experiments to investigate the lens performance. The final proposed lens provides the experiment results for all beam ports with an average value both return loss and mutual coupling of less than \u221215 dB and \u221220 dB, where the magnitude deviation in average value and the maximum error of phase difference are 1.172 dB and 6.014\u25e6, respectively. The proposed Rotman Lens is also confirmed t o be capable of controlling beam with scanning capability of \u221227\u25e6, \u221214\u25e6, 0\u25e6, 14\u25e6, 27\u25e6 to support wireless communication backbone link among MCRBSs in disaster recovery networks. \u00a9 IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.",

This research was conducted to determine the readiness of 5G implementation in Indonesia through techno-economic analysis for dense urban areas with a case study of Bandung City at a frequency of 2.3 GHz. The technical analysis consists of a link budget calculation, path loss calculation, and the number of gNodeB calculations. The propagation model used in this study is based on 3GPP TR 38.901, namely Urban Macro (UMa) and the outdoor environment. Then from the economic side, there are calculation of Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Payback Period (PP), and Profitability Index (PI). The results of the research from a technical analysis, show that the number of gNodeB that must be met is 55 for downlink and 35 for uplink communication. Based on the economic analysis, the results obtained NPV of Rp39,242,898,383, IRR of 8.90%, PP of 8 years 7 months, and PI of 1.12. The results obtained show that the implementation of 5G is feasible.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

Iteration always starts from the starting point to obtain the following solution point, leading to the convergence point. This paper presents a new method to solve economic load dispatch problems by narrowing the minimum and maximum power limits between generator units. This idea approximates the solution point with a tiny space formed by the very narrow power limits of each generator. The methodology used is the distance between the minimum and maximum power limits of each generator divided into several segments. Then, the best segment is determined by the minimum total cost calculated based on the center point of the segment. Continue to the following iteration process until the best segment is the smallest. This iteration process is another artificial method that works without calculus calculations, so it does not depend on the objective function. This method has been validated using two generator units with differentiable objective functions, with calculation accuracy less than 0.00001 MW of the power distance of the generator limit, and the iteration stops at the $23^{\\mathrm {rd}}$ step. Furthermore, this method has been successfully applied to the nondifferentiable objective function, piecewise and valve point effects.  \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "The Microstrip textile antenna is a form of wireless communication for human monitoring purpose that can be integrated with clothing while maintaining user comfort. However, microstrip antennas have several disadvantages such as low gain and efficiency, narrow bandwidth and surface waves that can damage the radiation pattern. The use of textile antennas also allows a mutual coupling effect between the body and the antenna that can change the resonance frequency, reduce antenna performance, and radiation hazard to the body. Based on these problems, an Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) structure is used with a unit cell in the shape of a Mushroom-like EBG and a via in the middle of the EBG. The use of the EBG structure can increase efficiency, reduce the effect of mutual coupling, create a better radiation pattern, and reduce radiation hazard to the body. Tests were carried out on antennas with and without EBG structures in the bandwidth range of 10-100 MHz for the 5G Band operating frequency of 3.5 GHz (n78 3500 MHz). In the 0 mm SAR test, the conventional antenna SAR is 2.4264 W/Kg, and the modified EBG antenna SAR is 1.082 W/Kg, there is a 55% reduction in SAR when the EBG structure is added. Thus, it is proven that the addition of EBG with modifications in this study can produce a minimum SAR value..In addition, there is an increase in bandwidth of 92% with the Conventional Antenna bandwidth of 27.30 MHz and the Modified EBG Antenna bandwidth and 52.50 MHz DGS with the test object on Hand.

One of the approaches to detect sleep disorders is by investigating human sleep stages. However, the selection of the proper electrocardiogram (ECG) features is still considered challenging and becomes an issue to achieve the performance of the algorithm used. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate which ECG features are very significant to the performance of the algorithm. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) method has been utilized to classify sleep stages into two classes namely awake and sleep. In order to improve the classification performances, an optimization method of grid search was used to find the best parameters of the SVM. Feature selection of information gain was then used to find the most significant ECG features. To validate the performance results, one leave-subject out cross-validation has been conducted during the implementation. There were ten subjects involved in this implementation. The ECG signals from those ten subjects were used to differentiate awake from sleep state. Based on the results, our method obtained an average accuracy of 85.46% a precision of 84.05% and a recall of 85.44% respectively. \u00a9 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

      "Process mining techniques can be used to analyse business processes using the data logged during their execution. These techniques are leveraged in a wide range of domains, including healthcare, where it focuses mainly on the analysis of diagnostic, treatment, and organisational processes. Despite the huge amount of data generated in hospitals by staff and machinery involved in healthcare processes, there is no evidence of a systematic uptake of process mining beyond targeted case studies in a research context. When developing and using process mining in healthcare, distinguishing characteristics of healthcare processes such as their variability and patient-centred focus require targeted attention. Against this background, the Process-Oriented Data Science in Healthcare Alliance has been established to propagate the research and application of techniques targeting the data-driven improvement of healthcare processes. This paper, an initiative of the alliance, presents the distinguishing characteristics of the healthcare domain that need to be considered to successfully use process mining, as well as open challenges that need to be addressed by the community in the future. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.",

      "Process mining techniques can be used to analyse business processes using the data logged during their execution. These techniques are leveraged in a wide range of domains, including healthcare, where it focuses mainly on the analysis of diagnostic, treatment, and organisational processes. Despite the huge amount of data generated in hospitals by staff and machinery involved in healthcare processes, there is no evidence of a systematic uptake of process mining beyond targeted case studies in a research context. When developing and using process mining in healthcare, distinguishing characteristics of healthcare processes such as their variability and patient-centred focus require targeted attention. Against this background, the Process-Oriented Data Science in Healthcare Alliance has been established to propagate the research and application of techniques targeting the data-driven improvement of healthcare processes. This paper, an initiative of the alliance, presents the distinguishing characteristics of the healthcare domain that need to be considered to successfully use process mining, as well as open challenges that need to be addressed by the community in the future. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc."

The rapid advance of neural networks and their intelligent technologies can scale up efforts to help deal with this problem. One of the technologies that can be applied in this context is computer vision with semantic segmentation, which can help automatically identify road surface damage. While a naive implementation of semantic segmentation often sacrifices running time and speed performance, in this study, we propose the lightweight encoder-decoder network model to overcome this issue. Numerical experiments show that this method gives us 110 minutes running time and is able to run at 26 fps, which can boost nearly 2\u00d7 than the baseline model's running time and speed performance for automated road surface damage identification tasks and can be extended to automatically measure the area of road damage and provide more meaningful information for decision-makers.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

Although deep learning models have shown that they can provide good results in identifying diseases from medical imagery, they suffer from the vulnerability of adversarial attacks, making them perform poorly. Several techniques can be applied to improve defense against such attacks. One of which is adversarial training (AT) which trains a deep learning model using the input's gradient used to generate noises to the input image and Deep k-Nearest Neighbor (DkNN) that enforces prediction's conformity based on nearest neighbor voting on each layer's representation. This work tries to improve the defense against adversarial attacks by combining AT and DkNN.

The more significant consequence of these two diseases is to disable one or more human capabilities. One of the stroke disease effects is becoming disabled from hearing.

      "As part of the early warning system, forest fire detection has a critical role in detecting fire in a forest area to prevent damage to forest ecosystems. In this case, the speed of the detection process is the most critical factor to support a fast response by the authorities. Thus, this article proposes a new framework for fire detection based on combining color-motion-shape features with machine learning technology. The characteristics of the fire are not only red but also from their irregular shape and movement that tends to be constant at specific locations. These characteristics are represented by color probabilities in the segmentation stage, color histograms in the classification stage, and image moments in the verification stage. A frame-based evaluation and an intersection over union (IoU) ratio was applied to evaluate the proposed framework. Frame-based evaluation measures the performance in detecting fires. In contrast, the IoU ratio measures the performance in localizing the fires. The experiment found that the proposed framework produced 89.97% and 10.03% in the true-positive rate and the false-negative rate, respectively, using the VisiFire dataset. Meanwhile, the proposed method can obtain an average of 21.70 FPS in processing time. These results proved that the proposed method is fast in the detection process and can maintain performance accuracy. Thus, the proposed method is suitable and reliable for integrating into the early warning system. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

      "Along with revenue, one of the necessary metrics in calculating gross profit for profitability analysis is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). The objective of measuring profitability with gross profit is to reckon how efficient an enterprise manages the labors and supplies in carrying out the production process or services provision. In allocating COGS for product profitability analysis, Activity-Based Costing (ABC) is a costing technique that allows cost allocation based on the activities carried out in the production process. Companies from various industries have adopted ABC with available supporting tools like ERP system. This paper will discuss a case study of a telecommunications company in Indonesia that implements SAP S/4HANA for the cost allocation with ABC and profitability analysis processes. The company still faces shortcomings in its daily business operation, particularly profitability analysis reporting. The current COGS report for profitability analysis in the implemented system does not provide information about the source of the cost allocation, thus causing it hard to trace and further analyze the cost of activities contributing to the production of a product. Report customization can be a solution to accommodate the information needed. This research explains the designing of report customization with ABAP List Viewer (ALV) by applying iterative incremental model approach. Customization of the report reduces the steps needed to trace and analyze business process sources from the allocated COGS of a product to only one single step.

      "The OFDM is a multicarrier technique that is well-known for its capability to cope with highly time-variant wireless channel. When combined with a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique, MIMO-OFDM system can offer reliable high data rate transmission over broadband wireless channels. In such system, the availability of channel state information (CSI) is critical issue that will determine overall performance of the system. CSI is commonly acquired through pilot-aided methods due to its simplicity and reliability. By taking advantage of the channel sparseness, compressive sensing (CS) can be utilized for channel estimation with much fewer pilot symbols. In this paper, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is employed to reconstruct channel impulse response. We evaluate the performance in terms of NMSE and BER. The simulation results shown that OMP algorithm outperforms LS in channel estimation with more efficient number of pilots. The BER performance also gives only slight difference compared to the system with known channel coefficient. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "The OFDM is a multicarrier technique that is well-known for its capability to cope with highly time-variant wireless channel. When combined with a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique, MIMO-OFDM system can offer reliable high data rate transmission over broadband wireless channels. In such system, the availability of channel state information (CSI) is critical issue that will determine overall performance of the system. CSI is commonly acquired through pilot-aided methods due to its simplicity and reliability. By taking advantage of the channel sparseness, compressive sensing (CS) can be utilized for channel estimation with much fewer pilot symbols. In this paper, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is employed to reconstruct channel impulse response. We evaluate the performance in terms of NMSE and BER. The simulation results shown that OMP algorithm outperforms LS in channel estimation with more efficient number of pilots. The BER performance also gives only slight difference compared to the system with known channel coefficient. \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

      "In recent years, the interaction between humans and computers has become a popular global challenge. The emergence of social robot technology, also known as Humanoid robot technology, is one manifestation of this interaction. How to create communication with humans is one of the most essential components of social robots. Nonverbal communication, such as reading body language and recognizing facial expressions, is one approach for robots to communicate. This study will design a facial expression recognition system using CNN method, which has been proven to be superior in the field of digital image-based classification. In the future, facial expression recognition will become increasingly common in human\u2013computer interface devices. Residual Network 34 architecture was used to classify the Cohn Kanade (CK+) data set consisting of 981 images, divided into seven classes of facial expressions; angry, disgust, fear, happy, sadness, surprise, and contempt. The investigation process is carried out by comparing three optimization algorithms: Adaptive moment (Adam), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). Based on the results of system testing, it shows that the ResNet-34 architecture has a fairly optimal performance in the classification of facial expressions, with an average accuracy of 99.3%, precision of 99.6%, recall of 99.3% and F1-Score of 99.4%. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

However, many industries still carry out the lumber quality inspection process manually, relying on human sight and instinct to compare many similar objects. To streamline the inspection process, this study developed a deep learning-based surface defect detection system with a proposed 'lightning YOLOv4' model. Specifically, to improve the model's performance speed, we simplify CSPDarknet53 and path aggregation network (PANet) for the feature extraction stage of YOLOv4 by reducing the convolution layers. Moreover, we introduce the simplification technique to reduce the number of channels in CSPDarknet53 by multiplying it with the scaling coefficient. In addition, we add spatial attention module (SAM) to the structures, which can improve whole system performance on two types of lumber datasets (pine and rubber lumber). According to the experimental results, the proposed detection system improves the average precision of defect localization with the highest gap of 1.3%, as well as improves the frames per second (FPS) by 10.8 points over the baseline.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

We show that in addition to the inherent off-axis aberrations that occur due to the hyperbolic phase profile of the metasurface, the focusing performance is significantly degraded due to the meta-atoms' angular dispersion. To obtain insights into how the angular and spectral bandwidth of meta-atoms relate to the metasurface focusing performance, point dipole models are used which incorporate different aspects of the meta-atoms' angular response. It is emphasized that despite the meta-atoms being designed under the assumption that they support a single dipolar resonance, other resonances exist within the meta-atom geometry and become stronger at oblique incidence. These resonances disturb the designed phase and amplitude responses, resulting in lower focusing efficiency at higher incident angles. The modeling of higher order modes leads to good agreement with the experimental measurements, confirming that angular dispersion of the meta-atoms is the dominant mechanism in determining off-axis aberrations.  \u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.",

Three free-ranging ringed seals (Phoca hispida botnica) were marked with GPS tags to track their movements in the Baltic Sea. The tracking data showed that ringed seals regularly transit between their haul-outs in the V\u00e4inameri and foraging areas in the southern part of the Gulf of Riga. On their way, the ringed seals pass through the Suur v\u00e4in (Suur Strait) and have to cross the Virtsu\u2013Kuivastu ferry route, where they are likely exposed to underwater ship-borne noise. Ringed seals\u2019 dive profiles were studied for the presence of avoidance reactions in response to ship-radiated noise. As a result, some dive profile irregularities were noticed in the form of deep dives or multiple surfacings. The received level (RL) causing the disturbance in ringed seals\u2019 behaviour was estimated based on sound propagation modelling. The obtained results are generally in line with previously reported studies on captive harbour seals and free-ranging grey seals. However, behavioural reactions observed in the current study are unlikely to adversely affect the energy budgets of ringed seals due to the short exposure time. \u00a9 2022 Authors.",

      "Learning rate is one of the challenging hyper-parameters during training deep learning model. An optimal model requires proper configuration value of learning rate. Larger learning rate results in rapid changes and makes the model not optimal, whereas smaller learning rate makes the model train slower. Finding a good choice of learning rate can be essential to getting the network to learn at all. In this paper, we proposed to compare the CenterNet model with different backbones and different learning rates. Backbones that we use are ResNet-101 and Deep Layer Aggregation, moreover there are eight experiments in total using different learning rate. CenterNet is a model based on keypoint estimation. In other words, CenterNet tries to find the center point of the object which is then regressed into other object properties such us weight and height of bounding boxes. Furthermore, we focus on detecting aerial images, hence the dataset we use is the VisDrone-2019 dataset. Our result shows that training Deep Layer Aggregation backbone using learning rate of 0.000125 can achieve the highest performances around 18.2 percent. \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

That mobile application has a purpose to detect, prevent, and control public health emergencies through point of entries. Besides, the users of the e-HAC application have trouble on using the application. The issues are specifically on navigation between the menus, and the lack of aesthetics and appealing of user interface. Those issues lead to the main purpose of this research, which is to upgrade the interface design of e-HAC application to a suitable User Interface by using User-Centered Design (UCD) method. There are also specific objectives: first is to conduct usability testing in form of questionnaires and interview two times: one is a pre-survey, to evaluate the problems of the e-HAC application based on user experience; and the another one is a post-survey, to find out whether the upgraded design that has been made can ease the users to access the e-HAC application. Then, the second specific objective is to implement the System Usability Scale (SUS) method for measuring the system usability based on questionnaires. After the implementation of the UCD method, the researcher re-surveyed and obtained a test scores of SUS, from 53.87 previously to, 85.12.

      "Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. One of the main risk factors for lung cancer is smoking, which causes more than 90% of lung cancer cases. There are two types of lung cancer, i.e., Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), which the latter is the most common. One method that can be used to detect cancer is the implementation of machine learning on gene expression data. Machine learning is one approach that promises good performance in classifying gene expression data. This study aimed to predict the existence of NSCLC based on gene expression, whether including NSCLC or normal. We used three data sets, i.e., GSE10072, GSE19804, and GSE19188, which relate to the cases of NSCLC in smokers and nonsmokers. The prediction was carried out using six Ensemble Methods, i.e., Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Extra Tree, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Categorical Boosting. Feature selection was carried out by calculating the correlation between feature and target according to statistical parameters, i.e., ANOVA, Mutual Information (MI), and a combination of ANOVA and MI. We obtained the prediction model that outperformed the related studies for two similar data sets with the value of accuracy for the GSE10072, GSE19804, and GSE19188 data sets 100%, 97.22%, and 100%, respectively \u00a9 2022 Fhira Nhita and Isman Kurniawan.

      "Shoreline change is critical information in coastal management. Eretan Beach located in Kandanghaur, Indramayu, has severe abrasion. In this research, we study the shoreline change of Eretan beach by using numerical experiments. Here, we use the Random Forest algorithm to forecast the shoreline change from historical data. This research data is obtained from the Google Earth Engine with CoastSat. The computational results show that the algorithm performs well in predicting actual data. The best MAE and RMSE at position 195 are obtained 3.77 and 6.91, respectively. Moreover, the standard deviation by MAE and RMSE is achieved at 0.05 and 0.03, respectively.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "With the advent of robust computing power, any sophisticated algorithm for data compression is becoming a trivial task. With more than petabytes of seismic data produced every day and the trend toward 4D survey, it is becoming essential to develop robust algorithms for the seismic data compression. This led to significant research efforts in data compression for field implementation, as shown by the research trends. The study of seismic data compression techniques is the main focus of this paper. In particular, we provide a short survey of different seismic data compression methods. This survey covers several categories of compression techniques, namely transformation, prediction, quantization, run length, and sampling. This paper can be deemed an initial attempt to provide an up-to-date overview of the research work carried in this all-important field of seismic data processing. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

      "A phonemicization or grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) is a process of converting a word into its pronunciation. It is one of the essential components in speech synthesis, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The deep learning (DL)-based state-of-the-art G2P model generally gives low phoneme error rate (PER) as well as word error rate (WER) for high-resource languages, such as English and European, but not for low-resource languages. Therefore, some conventional machine learning (ML)-based G2P models incorporated with specific linguistic knowledge are preferable for low-resource languages. However, these models are poor for several low-resource languages because of various issues. For instance, an Indonesian G2P model works well for roots but gives a high PER for derivatives. Most errors come from the ambiguities of some roots and derivative words containing four prefixes: \u3008ber\u3009, \u3008meng\u3009, \u3008peng\u3009, and \u3008ter\u3009. In this research, an Indonesian G2P model based on n-gram combined with stemmer and phonotactic rules (NGTSP) is proposed to solve those problems. An investigation based on 5-fold cross-validation, using 50 k Indonesian words, informs that the proposed NGTSP gives a much lower PER of 0.78% than the state-of-the-art Transformer-based G2P model (1.14%). Besides, it also provides a much faster processing time. \u00a9 2021 The Authors",

      "Solving urbanization problems, especially in developing countries, solely through the adoption of smartness in urban areas is insufficient as urbanization is mostly driven by the wide urban-rural economic gap. To narrow this gap, the adoption of smartness needs to be extended into rural areas. However, studies in that direction are still lacking. Therefore, we developed a theoretical model that explains the determinants of rural smartness and its subsequent consequences on rural economic welfare. We validated the model with survey data from 179 villages in West Java Province, Indonesia. The results suggest that rural smartness is determined by the interplay of organizational, environmental, and technological readiness, and has a strong positive impact on innovativeness which, in turn, improves the competitiveness of the rural business ecosystem.

      "When an epileptic seizure occurs, the neuron's activity of the brain is dynamically changed, which affects the connectivity between brain regions. The connectivity of each brain region can be quantified by electroencephalography (EEG) coherence, which measures the statistical correlation between electrodes spatially separated on the scalp. Previous studies conducted a coherence analysis of all EEG electrodes covering all parts of the brain. However, in an epileptic condition, seizures occur in a specific region of the brain then spreading to other areas. Therefore, this study applies an energy-based channel selection process to determine the coherence analysis in the most active brain regions during the seizure. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of inter-and intrahemispheric coherence in epileptic EEG signals and the correlation with the channel activity to glean insights about brain area connectivity changes during epileptic seizures. The EEG signals are obtained from ten patients' data from the CHB-MIT dataset. Pair-wise electrode spectral coherence is calculated in the full band and five sub-bands of EEG signals. The channel activity level is determined by calculating the energy of each channel in all patients. The EEG coherence observation in the preictal (Coh pre) and ictal (Coh ictal) conditions showed a significant decrease of Coh ictal in the most active channel, especially in the lower EEG sub-bands.

      "Currently, underwater communication is limited to sign language or additional tools such as a blackboard. Underwater voice communication itself is still becoming resistant due to acoustic waves, which have a propagation distance far but only have a small data rate (about kbps), and Radio Frequency (RF) which has a very short propagation distance, but with a high data rate (range up to Mbps). Underwater Visible Light Technology Communication (UVLC) was initiated to replace the role of waves carrier because besides having a long propagation distance, it also has a high data rate (up to Gbps). This research has tested the indoor and underwater channel tools with artificial seawater media. The transmitter uses Light Emitting Diode (LED) Super bright green LED or 500 nm wavelength, and the receiver uses a Positive Intrinsic Negative (PIN) photodiode of type BPW34. The experiment test scenario includes increasing the propagation distance and changing the angle. The output of this research is in the form of power received in dBm, internal sound level decibels a-weighting (dBA). After extensive testing, the result shows that the devices performance was stable, both indoor and underwater analysis. We also prove that the value of the received power and the sound level for excellent communication on the indoor channel is-6 dBm and 98.8 dBA. In addition, in the underwater channel, the value of transmit power and sound level is obtained at-10 dBm and 86.6 dBA. \u00a9 2022, International Association of Engineers. All rights reserved.",

      "The use of fossil energy which is always increasing from year to year makes it seem as if the world cannot be separated from these energy source. Therefore, it is necessary to find new energy sources where the energy can be renewable and available for a long time. In this research, a system is designed to predict the power output of PV. This system uses solar irradiation data and the power output of an off-grid solar power plant as the dataset. The dataset obtained from the PV output will be processed using an artificial neural network (ANN) with a backpropagation algorithm. The results of this study are able to predict the medium-term PV power output using the artificial neural network method by looking at the expected error values of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Tests are carried out to predict the PV power output for the next 11 days. The ANN model architecture uses 2 hidden layers with 3 neurons in the layer, 7 neurons in the second layer, and 190 epochs. This model has an error value of 25.837% for MAPE, 0.166 for MAE, 0.043 for MSE, and 0.209 for RMSE which categorizes the model as fairly feasible on predicting the next 11 days of PV power output.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was a condition beginning before more serious deterioration, leading to Alzheimer s dementia (AD). MCI detection was needed to determine the patient's therapeutic management. Analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence is one of the modalities for MCI detection. Therefore, this study investigated the inter and intra-hemispheric coherence over 16 EEG channels in the frequency range of 1-30 Hz. The simulation results showed that most of the electrode pair coherence in MCI patients have decreased compared to normal elderly subjects. In inter hemisphere coherence, significant differences (p 0.05) were found in the FP1-FP2 electrode pairs. Meanwhile, significant differences (p 0.05) were found in almost all pre-frontal area connectivity of the intra-hemisphere coherence pairs. The electrode pairs were FP2-F4, FP2-T4, FP1-F3, FP1-F7, FP1-C3, FP1-T3, FP1-P3, FP1-T5, FP1-O1, F3-O1, and T3-T5. The decreased coherence in MCI patients showed the disconnection of cortical connections as a result of the death of the neurons. Furthermore, the coherence value can be used as a multimodal feature in normal elderly subjects and MCI. It is hoped that current studies may be considered for early detection of Alzheimer s in a larger population. \u00a9 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.",

Previous studies identified that PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations in Telkom University Bandung have a similar trend data vertically up to 30 m above the ground. Therefore, this study was conducted to observe and analyze the distribution of pollutants in the vertical direction and broaden the measurement points using drones. A drone was chosen considering the available high building is limited, also to minimalize the spatial differences. The measuring parameters are PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations and meteorological conditions (temperature/T, relative humidity/RH, and pressure/P). Two different times are chosen that are at day time (August 31, 2019) and nighttime (September 30, 2019), at altitudes up to \u223c80m. During measurements, it was indicated that the change of the rotor or the drone's propeller speed affected the airflow. Results show that there are indications of PM2.5 deposition in the morning, which decreases to \u223c20 \u03bcg/m3 after the height of >40 m. The PM2.5 concentrations have been lifting and mixing evenly from the afternoon to the evening, increasing at night to \u223c15 \u03bcg/m3.

      "Index tracking aims to create a portfolio with a similar performance to the reference index using fewer stocks. Concerning index-tracking, the ability to map data sources in the form of investment return data, economics, or financial reports to predict investment return is essential. The promising method to accomplish it is deep learning. This study investigates the use of deep learning for portfolio index-tracking using LQ45 as the reference index. Autoencoder and Deep Neural Network are two Deep Learning techniques; Autoencoder is utilized for stock selection, and Deep Neural Network handles portfolio optimization index-tracking.

The result shows that portfolio index-tracking produced by this research has similar performance and even exceeds LQ45 performance, as demonstrated by the resulting error of less than 0.03. Finally, despite the risk of the index-tracking portfolio that is slightly higher than LQ45, however, the performance shown by the Deep Learning implementation is considered promising as, in some circumstances, the method shows lower error compared to other similar research.

      "Index tracking aims to create a portfolio with a similar performance to the reference index using fewer stocks. Concerning index-tracking, the ability to map data sources in the form of investment return data, economics, or financial reports to predict investment return is essential. The promising method to accomplish it is deep learning. This study investigates the use of deep learning for portfolio index-tracking using LQ45 as the reference index. Autoencoder and Deep Neural Network are two Deep Learning techniques; Autoencoder is utilized for stock selection, and Deep Neural Network handles portfolio optimization index-tracking.

      "Human activity recognition is one of the technologies to monitor a person's dynamism. Generally, to introduce human activities, they still use a camera, but the camera has weaknesses that depend on the intensity of the light. Therefore, radar is highly prioritized for human activity recognition systems because it is contactless and does not depend on light. This research is an implementation of the use of FMCW Radar. This change motion detection system is made by analyzing statistical characteristics in the data and using the Change Point Detection (CPD) algorithm. With the existence of a system of identifying the moment of human movement, it is hoped that the technology for the system of recognition of human activities can be implemented in various fields.

      "The navigation system is one of the most important and crucial concerns in the research of mobile robots. Perception, cognition, action, human-robot interaction, and control systems are among the difficulties that have been resolved. Each navigation system must handle the aforementioned common designs to ensure that all duties may be completed. The navigation system is built on learning techniques that provide the ability to reason in the face of environmental uncertainty. However, the design will be difficult to build due to a number of factors, including inherent uncertainties in the unorganized environment. A more expensive design cost, computational resources, and larger memory are all required in this case. Navigating an autonomous robot in an uncontrolled environment is difficult because it necessitates the cooperation of a number of subsystems. Mobile robots must be intelligent in order to adapt to navigation in unfamiliar environments, such as environmental cognition, behavioral decisions, and learning. The robot will then navigate around these obstacles without collapsing and arrive at a specific destination point. Combining two processes, such as environmental mapping and robot behaviors, can result in behavior-based navigation. Obstacle avoidance, wall following, corridor following, and target seeking are some examples. If only one of the two processes is used, the system should be used in two ways. When this approach is used, two major issues are bound to arise: I the combination of two simple behaviors to form a complex one, and (ii) the integration of more than two behaviors. Behavior induced by multiple concurrent goals can be smoothly blended into a dynamic sequence of control action. This study is concerned with the automatic navigation of a mobile robot from its starting point to its destination point.

      "Smart lighting systems utilize advanced data, control, and communication technologies and allow users to control lights in new ways. However, achieving user comfort, which should be the focus of smart lighting research, is challenging. One cause is the passive infrared (PIR) sensor that inaccurately detects human presence to control artificial lighting. We propose a novel classification-integrated moving average (CIMA) model method to solve the problem. The moving average (MA) increases the Pearson correlation (PC) coefficient of motion sensor features to human presence. The classification model is for a smart lighting intelligent control based on these features. Several classification models are proposed and compared, namely, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), n\u00e4ive Bayes (NB), and ensemble voting (EV). We build an Internet of things (IoT) system to collect movement data. It consists of a PIR sensor, a NodeMCU microcontroller, a Raspberry Pi-based platform, a relay, and LED lighting. With a sampling rate of 10 seconds and a collection period of 7 days, the system achieved 56852 data records. In the PC test, movement data from the PIR sensor has a correlation coefficient of 0.36 to attendance, while the MA correlation to attendance can reach 0.56. In an exhaustive search of an optimum classification model, KNN has the best and the most robust performance, with an accuracy of 99.8%. It is more accurate than direct light control decisions based on motion sensors, which are 67.6%. Our proposed method can increase the correlation value of movement features on attendance. At the same time, an accurate and robust KNN classification model is applicable for human presence-based smart lighting control.  \u00a9 2022 Aji Gautama Putrada et al.",

The moving average (MA) increases the Pearson correlation (PC) coefficient of motion sensor features to human presence. The classification model is for a smart lighting intelligent control based on these features. Several classification models are proposed and compared, namely, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), n\u00e4ive Bayes (NB), and ensemble voting (EV). We build an Internet of things (IoT) system to collect movement data. It consists of a PIR sensor, a NodeMCU microcontroller, a Raspberry Pi-based platform, a relay, and LED lighting. With a sampling rate of 10 seconds and a collection period of 7 days, the system achieved 56852 data records. In the PC test, movement data from the PIR sensor has a correlation coefficient of 0.36 to attendance, while the MA correlation to attendance can reach 0.56. In an exhaustive search of an optimum classification model, KNN has the best and the most robust performance, with an accuracy of 99.8%. It is more accurate than direct light control decisions based on motion sensors, which are 67.6%. Our proposed method can increase the correlation value of movement features on attendance. At the same time, an accurate and robust KNN classification model is applicable for human presence-based smart lighting control.  \u00a9 2022 Aji Gautama Putrada et al."

      "In 5G Network, Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) plays a substantial role in escalating network performance efficiency. Nevertheless, this C-RAN concept's main challenge lies in the need for a fronthaul network to handle high capacity and low delay. The Radio over Fiber (RoF) has been a solution to satisfy the high capacity and high-speed transmission required by the 5G fronthaul network. Keeping the attenuation effect low to achieve the minimum BER by using the optical amplifier is necessary. This paper investigates RoF by considering amplifier placement and different bitrate with 16-QAM modulation for Indonesia's 5G Fronthaul Network Implementation. Optical amplifier placement scenarios are pre-amplifier and booster amplifier. The results show that the booster amplifier scheme can cover a maximum fronthaul transmission distance of 20 km. As a comparison, the pre-amplifier scheme can reach a transmission distance of up to 15 km. Moreover, increasing the bitrate from 1 Gbps to 2.5 Gbps causes the BER value to increase. This result shows that different optical amplifiers and the increase in bit rate will affect the obtained BER values and limit the transmission distance that the fronthaul network can achieve.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

This paper investigates RoF by considering amplifier placement and different bitrate with 16-QAM modulation for Indonesia's 5G Fronthaul Network Implementation. Optical amplifier placement scenarios are pre-amplifier and booster amplifier. The results show that the booster amplifier scheme can cover a maximum fronthaul transmission distance of 20 km. As a comparison, the pre-amplifier scheme can reach a transmission distance of up to 15 km. Moreover, increasing the bitrate from 1 Gbps to 2.5 Gbps causes the BER value to increase. This result shows that different optical amplifiers and the increase in bit rate will affect the obtained BER values and limit the transmission distance that the fronthaul network can achieve.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

The results showed that the service restaurant rating predictions produced the best average MSE and RMSE accuracy in 5 and 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, the best hyperparameter of algorithms using Grid Search was achieved in restaurant rating prediction.

      "The development of IoT has penetrated various sectors. The development of IoT devices continues to increase and is predicted to reach 75 billion by 2025. However, the development of IoT devices is not followed by security developments. Therefore, IoT devices can become gateways for cyber attacks, including brute force and sniffing attacks. Authentication mechanisms can be used to ward off attacks. However, the implementation of authentication mechanisms on IoT devices is challenging. IoT devices are dominated by constraint devices that have limited computing. Thus, conventional authentication mechanisms are not suitable for use. Two-factor authentication using RFID and fingerprint can be a solution in providing an authentication mechanism. Previous studies have proposed a two-factor authentication mechanism using RFID and fingerprint. However, previous research did not pay attention to message exchange security issues and did not provide mutual authentication. This research proposes a secure mutual authentication protocol using two-factor RFID and fingerprint using MQTT protocol. Two processes support the authentication process: the registration process and authentication. The proposed protocol is tested based on biometric security by measuring the false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR) on the fingerprint, measuring brute force attacks, and measuring sniffing attacks. The test results obtained the most optimal FAR and FRR at the 80% threshold. Then the equal error rate (ERR) on FAR and FRR is around 59.5%. Then, testing brute force and sniffing attacks found that the proposed protocol is resistant to both attacks.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Background: In heart data mining and machine learning, dimension reduction is needed to remove multicollinearity. Meanwhile, it has been proven to improve the interpretation of the parameter model. In addition, dimension reduction can also increase the time of computing in high dimensional data. Methods: In this paper, we perform high dimensional ordination towards event counts in intensive care hospital for Emergency Department (ED 1), First Intensive Care Unit (ICU1), Second Intensive Care Unit (ICU2), Respiratory Care Intensive Care Unit (RICU), Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU), Subacute Respiratory Care Unit (RCC), Trauma and Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit (TNCU), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) which use the Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models (GLLVM\u2019s). Results: During the analysis, we measure the performance and calculate the time computing of GLLVM by employing variational approximation and Laplace approximation, and compare the different distributions, including Negative Binomial, Poisson, Gaussian, ZIP, and Tweedie, respectively. GLLVMs (Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models), an extended version of GLMs (Generalized Linear Models) with latent variables, have fast computing time. The major challenge in latent variable modelling is that the function f(\u0398) = \u222b f(u\u0398) h(u) du is not trivial to solve since the marginal likelihood involves integration over the latent variable u. Conclusions: In a nutshell, GLLVMs lead as the best performance reaching the variance of 98% comparing other methods. We get the best model negative binomial and Variational approximation, which provides the best accuracy by accuracy value of AIC, AICc, and BIC. In a nutshell, our best model is GLLVM-VA Negative Binomial with AIC 7144.07 and GLLVM-LA Negative Binomial with AIC 6955.922. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s).",

      "Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat that may cause serious problems such as cardiac arrest and heart failure if left untreated. A dozen of studies have been conducted to make an automated arrhythmia detector. The classification approach uses a simple rule-based model, traditional machine learning, to a modern deep-learning technique. However, comparing an arrhythmia classifier performance is not an easy task. There are several different datasets, classification standards, data splitting schemes, and metrics. To assess the real performance of the developed models, it is important to train and evaluate the model in a standardized method such as the result score can become standard too. In this study, a set of CNN models from Acharya were re-implemented by retraining and re-evaluating it in a more standardized method. The model uses a raw ECG waveform with 260 samples around the QRS peaks and classifies it into five arrhythmia classes. The experiment was conducted using three configurations, using both intra-patient and inter-patient schemes. The experimental results show good performance for the intra-patient scheme but not for the inter-patient. There is a reduction of sensitivity and precision in the intra-patient scheme using a standardized method in this study compared to the original paper. This result indicates biased results caused by the oversampled test data in the original paper.

We use Bayesian Logistic Regression to identify the factors of COVID-19 positivity, which can address issues in the traditional approach such as overfitting and uncertainty. This study discovers three main findings: (1) COVID-19 can infect people regardless of age; (2) Among twelve symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), five symptoms increase the COVID-19 likelihood, and two symptoms decrease the possibility of COVID-19 infection; and (3) From an epidemiological perspective, the contact history rises the probability of COVID-19, while healthcare workers and people who did travel are less likely to become infected from COVID-19.

Important things in an aquarium system are the level of ammonia in the water and the temperature of the water. Other research proposes several systems to make the aquarium control system robust for the aquarium monitoring and control system. However, those systems have weaknesses; namely, the user must actively access information to the server. This paper proposes a robust aquarium control system using the decision tree regression (DTR) algorithm. The development of this system was to overcome the problem of aquarium control by remote users. An accurate and real-time system is needed to monitor the aquarium so that it does not reach dangerous and critical points, such as in the case of an increase in water temperature. We did tests by developing an aquarium system connected to a server and an application that acts as a controller. Our measurements check the delay of sending data from the sensor to the server, process delay, actuator delay, user delay, and delay in reaching the aquarium's critical point. The measurement of the system's robustness is by calculating the probability of the information arrival to the user in the period of the critical point compared to the time needed to reach the critical point. Furthermore, we also made an analytical model based on the probability density function of the delay covered in this system.

      "The Malay archipelago has a rich numismatic legacy. However, identification of many native coins is still a challenge to this day, especially for those found in Indonesia. This study aims to re-examine a particular coin type made of tin-lead alloy with suspected copper content, reported to be found in the Musi river in south Sumatra. Available literature presumed the coin as a Siak issue, based on rather unsatisfactory reading of its inscription. While native Malay coins typically used Arabic Jawi for their inscription, the coin is unusual in using Indic script that can be described as a transitional form between late Kawi and early Modern Javanese, somewhat inclined towards the former. Through letterform comparison with artefacts such as N\u012btis\u0101rasamuccaya, this author proposes a revised reading of pang\u00e9ran ratu hing jambi, making this coin attributable to Jambi. The commercial success of the early 17th century Jambi sultanate and the propensity of its court to emulate Javanese-ness seemingly support this attribution. A narrower date range, however, could not be drawn as the inscription provides little orthographic or linguistic indications. Analogy with contemporaneous Banten copper coins suggests that the Jambi coin may have been used as a prestige item rather than common currency. \u00a9 2022 Editors, Indonesia and the Malay World.",

Eye detection is a further development of face detection in which the image of a human face was detected to be processed by detecting the location of both eyes on the face. Nowadays, the eye detection system can be used as a means of developing more complex applications and can be applied directly in the aspect of technology that uses eye detection like, eye state detection system, drowsiness and fatigue detection system, safety driving support systems or driver assistance system. In this study we propose drowsiness detection system utilizing current novel classification model such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), combined with Haar Cascade.

      "Background: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have recently been used as inflammatory biomarkers for cancer patients. This study aims to determine the role of pretreatment NLR, LMR, and PLR in predicting chemoresistance in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) patients. Material/Methods: A total of 129 low-risk and high-risk GTN patients who had received first-line chemotherapy were enrolled in this historical cohort study. The pretreatment NLR, LMR, and PLR values were analyzed to predict the resistance to first-line chemotherapy in low-risk and high-risk GTN patients. Results: Chemoresistant patients had significantly higher NLR than chemosensitive patients in low-risk and high-risk GTN patients (P<0.05). In high-risk GTN, patients with lower LMR and higher PLR tended to have chemoresistance to first-line chemotherapy (P=0.008, P=0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that the NLR, LMR, and PLR cut-off points of 2.654, 3.8, and 192.174, respectively, were associated with chemoresistance in high-risk GTN (P=0.0001, P=0.011, P=0.0001). The combination of NLR, PLR, and FIGO score in high-risk GTN was the best combination among other combinations with cut-off value >17 (P=0.001). Conclusions: Higher NLR, lower LMR, and higher PLR were associated with chemoresistance for high-risk GTN patients. Furthermore, NLR, LMR, and PLR can improve the accuracy of predicting resistance to first-line chemotherapy in high-risk GTN. \u00a9 Med Sci Monit.",

      "Background: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have recently been used as inflammatory biomarkers for cancer patients. This study aims to determine the role of pretreatment NLR, LMR, and PLR in predicting chemoresistance in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) patients. Material/Methods: A total of 129 low-risk and high-risk GTN patients who had received first-line chemotherapy were enrolled in this historical cohort study. The pretreatment NLR, LMR, and PLR values were analyzed to predict the resistance to first-line chemotherapy in low-risk and high-risk GTN patients. Results: Chemoresistant patients had significantly higher NLR than chemosensitive patients in low-risk and high-risk GTN patients (P<0.05). In high-risk GTN, patients with lower LMR and higher PLR tended to have chemoresistance to first-line chemotherapy (P=0.008, P=0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that the NLR, LMR, and PLR cut-off points of 2.654, 3.8, and 192.174, respectively, were associated with chemoresistance in high-risk GTN (P=0.0001, P=0.011, P=0.0001). The combination of NLR, PLR, and FIGO score in high-risk GTN was the best combination among other combinations with cut-off value >17 (P=0.001). Conclusions: Higher NLR, lower LMR, and higher PLR were associated with chemoresistance for high-risk GTN patients. Furthermore, NLR, LMR, and PLR can improve the accuracy of predicting resistance to first-line chemotherapy in high-risk GTN. \u00a9 Med Sci Monit."

However, companies such as P2P Lending has a data shortage, especially credit history data, so innovative credit models emerge to improve the ability to assess creditors. Along with technology development, we have the opportunity to extract data from social media. This study uses social media data to create models for assessing creditworthiness. We collect data from social media and then process it using the credit scoring scorecard, linear correlation formula, credit scoring model weight composition, and threshold according to expert judgments. We find that by using a greater weight of the demographic attributes, we receive more data in the good credit category.

      "Hippotherapy is a popular rehabilitation method for children with cerebral palsy (CP), which is done by riding an actual horse or a horse riding simulator (HRS) device. Riding a real horse is more expensive than using an HRS device due to its high maintenance cost. However, most HRS devices commonly sold in the market are designed as exercise devices, not rehabilitation devices. Most of them are designed to simulate a horse\u2019s walk, trot, canter, or gallop gait at various speeds. Hippotherapy aims to improve the walking ability of CP patients. Therefore, the device should aim to replicate the walking gait of a healthy human, the end goal of hippotherapy. This problem motivates us to design and build a specialized HRS device replicating the walking gait of a healthy human that is suitable for hippotherapy, which is achievable by simulating a horse walking gait with several adjustments. We first studied and observed the walking gait cycle of a horse, then analyzed and derived a formulation of it. We then continue by designing an HRS device using a single electrical rotational motor and mechanical means to replicate the walking gait of a horse, then tune it to an extent to replicate a human walking gait. To measure the performance of our design, we compare the gait of the user when riding our device versus walking. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

But behind the beauty of orchid plants, very good care is needed because orchids need the right moisture content and humidity in the room in order to grow well. The humidity that orchids need is 50% - 80% during the day. By using the help of the ESP8266 module and the DHT-11 Temperature Sensor, it can help to monitor orchid humidity and predict the humidity obtained in the next time. Also added a relay, and Mist Maker to help increase humidity. If the results of the prediction are less than 50%, the relay will automatically flow electric current to the mist maker and can help raise the humidity back to 50%. Predictions are obtained from the results of experimental humidity measurements carried out for 24 hours.

      "Purpose: In recent years, irreversible electroporation (IRE) has been developed to specifically destroy undesirable tissues as an alternative to surgical resection. In this treatment, placing multiple electrodes in parallel is required to create a uniform electric field distribution. The process of maintaining parallel electrodes is challenging, and the effect of the electrodes\u2019 orientation accuracy has not been investigated quantitatively. This study investigates the impact of the electrode orientation along with various electrode and pulse parameters on the outcomes of IRE. Methods: The electrode configurations that were considered were parallel, forward, and sideward orientation. A numerical model was developed to study the effect of electrode orientation on the electric field distribution, which was validated experimentally on potato tubers as it has similar properties to biological tissue. In addition, a conductivity test was performed to evaluate the conductivity and electroporation threshold of the potatoes. Results: The developed numerical model was validated by comparing the electroporated volumes between potatoes from the experiment and simulation, which achieved a mean dice score of 0.727 \u00b1 0.046. The potato has an electrical conductivity of 0.044\u20130.454 S/m with an electroporation threshold of 375 V/cm. ANOVA test showed that the difference in the electroporated regions obtained between a parallel orientation and a 5\u2218forward and sideward orientation was not significant. Conclusion: This study showed that the developed numerical models were validated and able to predict the outcome of IRE on potatoes. In addition, a 5\u2218tolerance on the electrode orientation can be defined to obtain a similar response to the parallel orientation. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s).",

      "As one of the statistical-based models, an n-gram syllabification commonly gives a high syllable error rate (SER) for Bahasa Indonesia, one of the low-resource languages, since it fails for a high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate. Two previous models: bigram-syllabification with flipping onsets (BFO) and a combination of bigram with backoff smoothing based on phonological similarity (CBSPS), which use augmentation methods, can reduce the OOV rate. However, there are two problems in both BFO and CBSPS. First, they use an n-gram that is applied syllable-level, instead of grapheme-level, so that they suffer on the sparsity of n-grams. Second, they rely on a procedure to detect the positions of both vowels and diphthongs. Both problems make them not capable of distinguishing diphthongs from derivative words as well as syllabifying named-entities, which have many ambiguities related to vowels and semi-vowels. In this paper, a syllabification based on an n-gram tagger, which is applied on grapheme-level and does not rely on both vowel and diphthong detections, is developed to solve both problems. Besides, three data augmentation methods are exploited to enrich the dataset. The 5-fold cross-validations (5-FCV) using both datasets of 50 k words and 15 k named-entities show that the proposed augmented-syllabification of n-gram tagger (ASnGT) model is significantly better than both BFO and CBSPS. It is also significantly better than the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor in every class (FkNNC)-based model for formal words and named-entities. However, it suffers from derivative words, where it cannot easily distinguish them from both absorption words and terms of foreign languages. Besides, it also undergoes some foreign named-entities. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)",

According to the website administrator, SIM BBLM users complained about the web being unresponsive, not easy, and having various non-optimal functions, such as data entry or display failures. Due to limited time and human resources, MIDC's IT management did not include the SIM BBLM quality evaluation process in its scope of work. Therefore, this research performed a user-based evaluation method to help the SIM BBLM Evaluation Process. The researcher used Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) to test the evaluation findings from earlier user assessments using the ISO 25010 questionnaire. The IPA results revealed seven quality attributes of the SIM BBLM web, including Functional Suitability (F1), Reliability (R1), and Usability (U1, U4, U6, U7, and U8), that were prioritized for improvement. Based on the experiment, the performance values between the improved SIM BBLM web and the current SIM BBLM web have increased, while each attribute got positive gaps. This improvement has been supported by comparing 3.24 as the current website's average performance value with 4.16 as the improved website's score. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

Due to limited time and human resources, MIDC's IT management did not include the SIM BBLM quality evaluation process in its scope of work. Therefore, this research performed a user-based evaluation method to help the SIM BBLM Evaluation Process. The researcher used Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) to test the evaluation findings from earlier user assessments using the ISO 25010 questionnaire. The IPA results revealed seven quality attributes of the SIM BBLM web, including Functional Suitability (F1), Reliability (R1), and Usability (U1, U4, U6, U7, and U8), that were prioritized for improvement. Based on the experiment, the performance values between the improved SIM BBLM web and the current SIM BBLM web have increased, while each attribute got positive gaps. This improvement has been supported by comparing 3.24 as the current website's average performance value with 4.16 as the improved website's score. \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

The PVA/CNC biocomposite films were prepared by solvent casting method with different CNC content (3; 6; and 9 wt. %,). The prepared biocomposites were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while the thermal properties were studied using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). SEM showed the morphology of all samples where the difference among samples where the surface roughness of the samples was more at higher concentration of CNC. TGA results showed that the highest onset thermal degradation temperature was recorded at 254 \u00b0C for PVA/CNC 6 wt% compared to other samples. The value of char residue also increased up to 3.2% for PVA/CNC 9 wt% indicating the good thermal effect of CNC on PVA for the biocomposites heating-resistant properties. DSC results revealed that with the addition of CNC, all of the biocomposites peaks move to higher temperatures showing that CNC improves the thermal stability of the composites. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).",

      "We report the characterization of an achromatic focusing metasurface at oblique incident angles. We show that in addition to the inherent off-axis aberrations that occur due to the hyperbolic phase profile of the metasurface, the focusing performance is significantly degraded due to the meta-atoms' angular dispersion. To obtain insights into how the angular and spectral bandwidth of meta-atoms relate to the metasurface focusing performance, point dipole models are used which incorporate different aspects of the meta-atoms' angular response. It is emphasized that despite the meta-atoms being designed under the assumption that they support a single dipolar resonance, other resonances exist within the meta-atom geometry and become stronger at oblique incidence. These resonances disturb the designed phase and amplitude responses, resulting in lower focusing efficiency at higher incident angles. The modeling of higher order modes leads to good agreement with the experimental measurements, confirming that angular dispersion of the meta-atoms is the dominant mechanism in determining off-axis aberrations.  \u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.",

      "Recently, acquiring the Random Access Memory (RAM) full memory and access data is gaining significant interest in digital forensics. However, a security feature on the Windows operating system - Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) - presents challenges to the acquisition process by causing a system crash known as a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD). The crash is likely to occur when memory acquisition tools are being used. Subsequently, it disrupts the goal of memory acquisition since the system must be restarted, and the RAM content is no longer available. This study analyzes the implications of VSM on memory acquisition tools as well as examines to what extent its impact on the acquisition process. Two memory acquisition tools, namely FTK Imager and Belkasoft RAM Capturer, were used to conduct the acquisition process. Static and dynamic code analyses were performed by using reverse engineering techniques that are disassembler and debugger. The results were compared based on the percentage of unreadable memory between active and inactive VSM. Static analysis showed that there is no difference between all applications\u2019 functions for both active and inactive VSM. Further Bugcheck analysis of the MEMORY.DMP is pointed to the ad_driver.sys module in FTK Imager that causes the system to crash.

      "Vendor managed inventory (VMI) is a popular supply chain system where vendor or supplier take responsibility and decision in managing its customers' inventory. Two important goals of the VMI are improving service level and maintaining inventory still low and available. Many studies in VMI compare their performance with the traditional system. Unfortunately, studies in improving VMI performance are rare. This work aims to improve VMI by implementing Weighted Round Robin (WRR), a popular scheduling model in computer system, in the replenishment model in VMI. WRR is popular because of its load balancing nature. Environment in this work is two-echelon supply chain. The vendor is a multi-product manufacturer. The customers are retailers. This WRR based replenishment model is then compared with two common replenishment models: (s, S) model and (r, Q) model. In this work, we observe two performance parameters: sales and inventory condition. Based on the simulation result, it is shown that the WRR model performs better than the existing (s, S) model and (r, Q) model and it occurs in most of the observed variables. In the certain condition, performance of the WRR model compared with the (s, S) model and the (r, Q) model is as follows. The WRR model performs 31 percent better than the (s, S) model and 12 percent better than the (r, Q) model in success ratio. Manufacturer's stock in the WRR model is only 36 percent than in the (s, S) model and 40 percent than in the (r, Q) model.

      "Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) issued Secure Zero Touch Provisioning (SZTP) as a provisioning technique for networking devices without human intervention. SZTP standardizes the provisioning workflow from device enrollment to bootstrapping process. Unfortunately, implementing a single trust model of public key infrastructure scheme in zero-touch device provisioning is vulnerable to impersonation attacks using bogus certificates. This paper proposes a robust protocol for the bootstrapping process of edge devices by integrating the Attack Resilient Public Key Infrastructure (ARPKI) scheme with SZTP. As a transparent and accountable public key infrastructure, ARPKI can prevent the miss-issuance of a certificate. ARPKI offers strong security as certificate management for SZTP. We adopt the security properties of ARPKI to construct an accountable bootstrapping scheme of a zero-touch provisioned edge device against threats, e.g., impersonation, incurred by insiders compromised by adversaries. The edge device and bootstrap server can confidently build mutual authentication using the TLS 1.3 full handshake protocol together with the ARPKI-based certificates built upon a trusted public certificate log, which provides the accountability of the certificate. We analyze our scheme's security properties by performing formal and informal analyses. We show that the combination of ARPKI and SZTP can detect malicious entities and mitigate misbehaving activities. Our provisioning scheme provides accountable bootstrapping for edge devices in a zero-touch fashion with integrity and confidentiality of bootstrapping data.  \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "Web services are provided with documents that at the very least specify the endpoint, input parameters, and output or response of each operation to expose their capabilities. This should be considered through an understandable format for humans and/or machines. In the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is used as a reference to create web service descriptions. However, it only supports syntactic interoperability, leading to the incapability of supporting the automated selection process. To overcome this, OAS documents must be enhanced by including semantics to each resource to provide \u201cunderstandable\u201d services. Therefore, this study aims to develop a system capable of transforming resources in OAS documents into RDF-based semantic web services. To begin, a relational database schema based on the OAS structure is created to store all objects in the OAS document. The published open-linked vocabulary was then used to create the ontology, which maps resources and their relationships on the RDF data model. To build RDF-based semantic web services, R2RML was used to generate the relational database model into triple RDF. The proposed system was also tested through prototyping and using a dataset of 106 OAS documents, which were downloaded from APIs.guru between 5\u201310 May 2021. The number of triple RDFs generated per document varied with resource rate. An OAS document generates 36 to 16,505 triple RDF in a dataset. The end product was a triple RDF knowledge base maintained by a graph management database. It is now possible to find service operations, input and output parameters, and service composition requirements utilizing the repository semantic web services using SPARQL. On the other hand, the use of relational databases to store OAS resources increased reuse efficiency by approximately 48%, owing to service developers designing interoperability between uniform parameter services, which were then used as input and output. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s).",

      "In the vendor-managed inventory (VMI) system, the vendor takes over responsibility for managing customer inventory so that delivery is not based on the order but the customer\u2019s inventory condition. It makes the vendor becomes a dominant entity, and customers are supplied by its own vendor exclusively. That is why most studies in VMI implement a single-vendor-single-customer or single-vendor-multi-customer scenario. In certain conditions, this exclusiveness can increase lost sales. Besides, most of them implement a single product scenario. In this work, we develop VMI model for the multi-vendor-customer-product scenario. This model is developed based on the collaborative multi-agent system. The relationship between vendors and customers is many-to-many. This work aims to reduce lost sales and maintain efficiency in the inventory. The continuous review (r, Q) policy is used as the replenishment model. The simulation result shows that the collaborative model creates higher sales, lower lost sales, and competitive inventory than the non-collaborative one. The lost sales is 50 to 75 percent lower. The sales percentage is 17 to 27 percent higher. The total retailers\u2019 stock is 20 to 38 percent higher. The total vendors\u2019 stock is 11 to 30 percent lower. The total stock in the supply chain in the collaborative model is 2 to 16 percent higher. The number of retailers is directly proportional to the total vendor\u2019s stock and total supply chain stock gaps; inversely proportional to the lost sales gap; and not related to the sales percentage and total retailers\u2019 stock gaps. \u00a9 2022 Institut za Istrazivanja.

      "Background: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have recently been used as inflammatory biomarkers for cancer patients. This study aims to determine the role of pretreatment NLR, LMR, and PLR in predicting chemoresistance in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) patients. Material/Methods: A total of 129 low-risk and high-risk GTN patients who had received first-line chemotherapy were enrolled in this historical cohort study. The pretreatment NLR, LMR, and PLR values were analyzed to predict the resistance to first-line chemotherapy in low-risk and high-risk GTN patients. Results: Chemoresistant patients had significantly higher NLR than chemosensitive patients in low-risk and high-risk GTN patients (P<0.05). In high-risk GTN, patients with lower LMR and higher PLR tended to have chemoresistance to first-line chemotherapy (P=0.008, P=0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that the NLR, LMR, and PLR cut-off points of 2.654, 3.8, and 192.174, respectively, were associated with chemoresistance in high-risk GTN (P=0.0001, P=0.011, P=0.0001). The combination of NLR, PLR, and FIGO score in high-risk GTN was the best combination among other combinations with cut-off value >17 (P=0.001). Conclusions: Higher NLR, lower LMR, and higher PLR were associated with chemoresistance for high-risk GTN patients. Furthermore, NLR, LMR, and PLR can improve the accuracy of predicting resistance to first-line chemotherapy in high-risk GTN. \u00a9 Med Sci Monit.",

      "Hippotherapy is a popular rehabilitation method for children with cerebral palsy (CP), which is done by riding an actual horse or a horse riding simulator (HRS) device. Riding a real horse is more expensive than using an HRS device due to its high maintenance cost. However, most HRS devices commonly sold in the market are designed as exercise devices, not rehabilitation devices. Most of them are designed to simulate a horse\u2019s walk, trot, canter, or gallop gait at various speeds. Hippotherapy aims to improve the walking ability of CP patients. Therefore, the device should aim to replicate the walking gait of a healthy human, the end goal of hippotherapy. This problem motivates us to design and build a specialized HRS device replicating the walking gait of a healthy human that is suitable for hippotherapy, which is achievable by simulating a horse walking gait with several adjustments. We first studied and observed the walking gait cycle of a horse, then analyzed and derived a formulation of it. We then continue by designing an HRS device using a single electrical rotational motor and mechanical means to replicate the walking gait of a horse, then tune it to an extent to replicate a human walking gait. To measure the performance of our design, we compare the gait of the user when riding our device versus walking. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

This is achieved through an electromagnetic approach using a pair of transceiver coils as a sensor. Determination of water content in the soil is carried out through the formulation of an equation model that connects the measured voltage on the receiving coil with the mass of water contained. It is known that the use of the equation model in the test data results in better accuracy with an error of 2.03% - 17.43%, compared to measurements using a moisture measuring device with an error of 13.21% - 32%.

      "Apple classification is needed in various automation in the agricultural product processing industry. Classification of a small number of apples is very easy for humans to do, but in large numbers, manual work becomes less reliable. This study aims to build a model that can be used for automatic apple classification. The model is built using classification algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine. A number of images on the apple variant, named envy, fuji, malang, and gala, were used for learning. The images are converted to grayscale and resized to a certain size for computational efficiency.

      "Apple classification is needed in various automation in the agricultural product processing industry. Classification of a small number of apples is very easy for humans to do, but in large numbers, manual work becomes less reliable. This study aims to build a model that can be used for automatic apple classification. The model is built using classification algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine. A number of images on the apple variant, named envy, fuji, malang, and gala, were used for learning. The images are converted to grayscale and resized to a certain size for computational efficiency. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the model in recognizing the apple image reaches 94.00 % and 94.50% for the k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine, respectively.

      "Hippotherapy is a popular rehabilitation method for children with cerebral palsy (CP), which is done by riding an actual horse or a horse riding simulator (HRS) device. Riding a real horse is more expensive than using an HRS device due to its high maintenance cost. However, most HRS devices commonly sold in the market are designed as exercise devices, not rehabilitation devices. Most of them are designed to simulate a horse\u2019s walk, trot, canter, or gallop gait at various speeds. Hippotherapy aims to improve the walking ability of CP patients. Therefore, the device should aim to replicate the walking gait of a healthy human, the end goal of hippotherapy. This problem motivates us to design and build a specialized HRS device replicating the walking gait of a healthy human that is suitable for hippotherapy, which is achievable by simulating a horse walking gait with several adjustments. We first studied and observed the walking gait cycle of a horse, then analyzed and derived a formulation of it. We then continue by designing an HRS device using a single electrical rotational motor and mechanical means to replicate the walking gait of a horse, then tune it to an extent to replicate a human walking gait. To measure the performance of our design, we compare the gait of the user when riding our device versus walking. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

Overestimated or underestimated forecasting value may lead to inefficiency of electricity generator or electricity deficiency in the electricity grid system. Parameters that may affect electricity demand are the weather conditions at the location of the electricity system. In this paper, we investigate possible weather parameters that affect electricity load. As a case study, we choose an area with an isolated electricity system, i.e., Bali Island, in Indonesia. We calculate correlations of various weather parameters with electricity load in Bali during the period 2018\u20132019. We use two machine learning models to design an electricity load forecasting system, i.e., the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using features from various weather parameters. We design scenarios that add one-by-one weather parameters to investigate which weather parameters affect the electricity load. The results show that the weather parameter with the highest correlation value with the electricity load in Bali is the temperature, which is then followed by sun radiation and wind speed parameter. We obtain the best prediction with GRNN and SVR with a correlation coefficient value of 0.95 and 0.965, respectively. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

It is because the operational cost of using this signal is relatively lower than other signals, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG). However, PPG signal is very susceptible to noise. Therefore, removing noise from the PPG signal data is a must. In most cases, the noise in this signal is much worse than the ECG signal. In addition, most existing research on denoising algorithms based on PPG signals is incomprehensive due to focusing on single denoising algorithm. This research provides a solution to the problems by proposing a performance study of three denoising algorithms for PPG signals, i.e., Savitzky Golay, Butterworth, and Finite Impulse Response (FIR). Method used to achieve the objective are literature study on denoising algorithms, conduct experiments on the proposed algorithms, measure and analyze the performance of the denoising algorithms based on three metrics, namely Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE). Rigorous experiments have been carried out, and it is proven that Savitzky's algorithm is better than the other two algorithms (i.e., Butterworth and FIR).

      "In this research, the effect of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) on the thermal properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) / cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) biocomposite was investigated. The PVA/CNC biocomposite films were prepared by solvent casting method with different CNC content (3; 6; and 9 wt. %,). The prepared biocomposites were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while the thermal properties were studied using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). SEM showed the morphology of all samples where the difference among samples where the surface roughness of the samples was more at higher concentration of CNC. TGA results showed that the highest onset thermal degradation temperature was recorded at 254 \u00b0C for PVA/CNC 6 wt% compared to other samples. The value of char residue also increased up to 3.2% for PVA/CNC 9 wt% indicating the good thermal effect of CNC on PVA for the biocomposites heating-resistant properties. DSC results revealed that with the addition of CNC, all of the biocomposites peaks move to higher temperatures showing that CNC improves the thermal stability of the composites. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).",

      "Malaria is a dangerous endemic disease that infects millions yearly. The Plasmodium falciparum species are responsible for most malaria deaths. Currently, most available antimalarial drugs are less effective due to the increased parasite's resistance to drugs. Hence, novel antimalarial agents with high efficiency to inhibit malaria are urgently needed. Falcipain enzyme is a promising target protein for developing new anti-malaria. However, conventional laboratory testing to design new drugs takes time and is very expensive. Therefore, the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) can be used to accelerate the drug design process. In this study, we developed a QSAR model using a genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) to predict the pIC50 values of falcipain inhibitors. The GA was utilized as a feature selection method, while SVM with an optimized hyperparameter was used to develop the prediction models. We performed three models with different SVM kernels, i.e., linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial. The model performance was validated using both internal and external data. The validation results show that the RBF model produced the best result, with the $R^{2}$ values of the training and test sets of 0.98 and 0.84, respectively, while $Q^{2}$ of the leave-one-out cross-validation was 0.85.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

Gold is used as an investment because of the nature of gold that can maintain its value from inflation. Furthermore, gold price prediction is essential because it can reduce investment risk, thus assisting in determining investment policy. Gold price data has high fluctuation characteristics. Therefore, the Conv-LSTM algorithm has been used to predict gold prices within daily and weekly time frames. Conv-LSTM will be tested using four parameters with a testing ratio of 20% and 40%. Performance measurement generated by the model is carried out using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results obtained for daily data with a ratio of 20% are 9.658063 MAE and 14,83934 RMSE, and for a 40% ratio are 8.680931 MAE and 12,92464 RMSE. The results obtained for weekly data with a ratio of 20% are 21.86957 MAE and 31.49406 RMSE, and for a ratio of 40% are 21.05697 MAE and 28.2758 RMSE.

      "Conflict situations in football have become a significant issue because they affect the players, supporters, referees, management team, the governing body of football, and the government. As time passes, the discovery of conflicts within the football industry has also become increasingly diverse; both affected in-game or out of the game. In 2015, Indonesia had no activity in football for almost a year when the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) banned the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) from competing in international competitions until the conflict among their internal agents was resolved. The agents involved in this highly controversial ban include the Commission 10 of the Parliament of Indonesia, the National Sports Committee of Indonesia (KONI), the Indonesian President, and the Ministry of Youth and Sport of Indonesia. Conflict resolution strategies outside the football games are delicate and more challenging to overcome due to the involvement of the government and various governing bodies. This opens to higher unpredictability in modeling the conflict situations, hence a lower possibility of a successful conflict resolution model strategy. In addressing this gap, this paper proposes a new Computational Intelligence approach based on the Soft Set Theory, where an alternative algorithm is derived from modeling the conflict situations. We then delineated the proposed algorithm for an instructional example of the Indonesian football conflict situation in 2015 concerning the Indonesia Football Super League. The results showed that the proposed algorithm successfully handled conflict and recommended the Indonesian football agents involved, including PSSI and FIFA. \u00a9 2022.

      "Detecting absorption gaps in a nailfold capillary can be used to quantify an estimation of white blood cells (WBCs). Previously, the absorption gaps in a nailfold capillary were usually measured using a standard camera on a fingernail. However, difficulties arise due to low visibility of the gap, the small size of the capillaries, the high speed of WBC movement, and the lack of contrast between the capillary and its environment/background. To address these issues, an event-based WBC image is utilized as input data to detect WBC existence in the nailfold. Specifically, we utilize a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) camera, which can detect a change in luminance on a pixel basis and can produce a stream of asynchronous event output at a microsecond temporal resolution. With the event-based WBC dataset, we conduct a classification task using three different machine learning algorithms: k-nearest neighbors, the decision tree, and random forest. The best result is from random forest with 75.51% accuracy.

With the event-based WBC dataset, we conduct a classification task using three different machine learning algorithms: k-nearest neighbors, the decision tree, and random forest. The best result is from random forest with 75.51% accuracy. Based on our evaluation, event-based WBC classification is a promising new approach to detecting WBC presence in nailfold capillaries. \u00a9 2022 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers.

      "The occurrence of post-sunset equatorial spread-F (ESF) could have detrimental effects on trans-ionospheric radio wave propagation used in modern communications systems. This problem calls for a simple but robust model that accurately predicts the occurrence of post-sunset ESF. Logistic regression was implemented to model the daily occurrence of post-sunset ESF as a function of the evening upward plasma drift (v). The use of logistic regression is formalized by \u0177 = 1/[1 + exp(\u2212z)], where \u0177 represents the probability of post-sunset ESF occurrence, and z is a linear function containing v. The value of v is derived from the vertical motion of the bottom side of the F-region in the evening equatorial ionosphere, which is observed by the ionosondes in Southeast Asia. Data points (938) of v and post-sunset ESF occurrence were collected in the equinox seasons from 2003 to 2016. The training set used 70% of the dataset to derive z and \u0177 and the remaining 30% was used to test the performance of \u0177. The expression z = \u22122.25 + 0.14v was obtained from the training set, and \u0177 \u2265 0.5 (v \u2265 ~16.1 m/s) and \u0177 < 0.5 (v < ~16.1 m/s) represented the occurrence and non-occurrence of ESF, respectively, with an accuracy of ~0.8 and a true skill score (TSS) of ~0.6. Similarly, in the testing set, \u0177 shows an accuracy of ~0.8 and a TSS of ~0.6. Further analysis suggested that the performance of the z-function can be reliable in the daily F10.7levels ranging from 60 to 140 solar flux units. The z-function implemented in the logistic regression (\u0177) found in this study is a novel technique to predict the post-sunset ESF occurrence. The performance consistency between the training set and the testing set concludes that the z-function and the \u0177 values of the proposed model could be a simple and robust mathematical model for daily nowcasting the occurrence or non-occurrence of post-sunset ESFs. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

      "Kites stuck in the electricity network often cause blackouts, especially in West Kalimantan. There were 426 power outages triggered by kite wires in 2018, 219 cases in 2019 and 297 cases in 2020. The method to find the location of kites stuck in the electricity network is still not efficient enough and takes a long time.

      "Traditional approaches to recommendation systems involve using collaborative filtering and content-based techniques which make use of the similarities between users and items respectively. Such approaches evolved to encapsulate model-based latent factor (LF) algorithms that use matrix decomposition to ingest a user-item matrix of ratings to generate recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on 3D LF model and tensor decomposition method for devising personalized recommendations driven from additional contextual features. We also present our stacking method for a tensor generation prior to incorporating LF models. We validate our proposed personalized recommender using two real-world datasets. Our experimental results showed that additional contextual features can help to personalize recommendations while maintaining similar or better performance compared to conventional 2D LF methods. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the importance of the quality of the contextual features to be used in 3D LF models.

      "Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been widely studied for biometric recognition (or subject identification) applications over the past decade. Many techniques have been offered as well, from traditional computing to machine learning techniques. However, most studies evaluate their proposed models by independently separating the datasets between healthy (normal) and unhealthy (abnormal/arrhythmia) heart conditions. Some studies even used the ECG signal datasets from subjects only under healthy heart conditions. We believe that developing an ECG-based biometric system that includes the heart, both under healthy and unhealthy conditions, is highly needed since the users might be in both conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature, which considers the combination of the dataset of ECG signals from subjects under the healthy heart and unhealthy (arrhythmia) conditions in training, validation, and even testing processes. We combined the datasets from MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia databases obtained from Physionet. From the combination of those databases, we obtained a total of 32,628 datasets from 89 subjects which were later modeled using a machine learning technique, i.e., one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CONV1D). This study aims to build a light-weight yet reliable ECG-based biometric system by implementing only two layers of the convolutional neural network into those joined datasets. We evaluated the model's performance with k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) and yielded the accuracy and F1-scores of 99.8% And 99.8% respectively. We also proved that our model is a good fitting (not under/over-fitting) by providing the visualization plot of accuracy and loss. These findings show that our model is robust enough for ECG-based subject identification, which can be implemented for healthy and unhealthy heart conditions. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Neurologists usually do manual seizure analysis, yet it is time-consuming, tedious, and costive. Thus, an automated system of seizure detection is needed to assist the analysis. In this study, EEG signals of the CHB-MIT dataset are evaluated in digital signal processing using a machine learning approach. The EEG signals are filtered by applying a Butterworth bandpass filter (BPF). The mean channel selection is then applied to simplify the number of channels used in all patients. The channels are selected based on the energy value. Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) is used to decompose the signals into several scales. The features are extracted using two entropy analyses, the Shannon Entropy (ShEN) and Renyi's Entropy (RE). This study used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the feature set.

In this paper, a new KNN variant called multi-voter multi-commission nearest neighbor (MVMCNN) is proposed to examine its benefits in enhancing the LMPNN. As the name suggests, MVMCNN uses some commissions: each calculates the total distance between the given query point (test pattern) and k pseudo nearest neighbors using the LMPNN scheme. The decision class is defined by minimizing those total distances. Hence, the decision in MVMCNN is obtained more locally than LMPNN. Examination based on 10-fold cross-validation shows that the proposed multi-commission scheme can enhance the original (single-commission) LMPNN. Compared with two single-voter models: KNN and Bonferroni Mean Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbors (BM-FKNN), the proposed MVMCNN also gives lower mean error rates as well as higher Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, indicating that the multi-voter model provides a better decision than the single-voter ones. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)",

      "A dataset with good quality is a valuable asset for a company. The data can be processed into information to help companies improve decision-making. However, the data increased more and more over time to decrease data quality. Thus, good data management is important to keep data quality meeting company standards. One of the efforts that can be done is conducting data cleansing to clean data from errors, inaccuracies, duplication, format discrepancies, etc. Apache Spark is an engine that can analyze large amounts of data. Oracle Database is a database management system used to manage databases. Both have their own reliability and can be used to analyze SQL-shaped data. This study compared Spark and Oracle performance based on query processing time. Both were tested on queries used to perform data cleansing of millions of rows of the dataset. The research focuses on finding out Spark and Oracle's performance through quantitative analysis. The results of this study showed that there were differences in query processing times on both tools. Apache Spark is rated better because it has a relatively faster query processing time than Oracle Database. It can be concluded that Oracle is more reliable in storing complex data models than in analyzing large data. For future research, it is suggested to add other comparison aspects such as memory and CPU usage. The researchers can also consider using query optimization techniques to enrich query experiments. \u00a9 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.",

One of the efforts that can be done is conducting data cleansing to clean data from errors, inaccuracies, duplication, format discrepancies, etc. Apache Spark is an engine that can analyze large amounts of data. Oracle Database is a database management system used to manage databases. Both have their own reliability and can be used to analyze SQL-shaped data. This study compared Spark and Oracle performance based on query processing time. Both were tested on queries used to perform data cleansing of millions of rows of the dataset. The research focuses on finding out Spark and Oracle's performance through quantitative analysis. The results of this study showed that there were differences in query processing times on both tools. Apache Spark is rated better because it has a relatively faster query processing time than Oracle Database. It can be concluded that Oracle is more reliable in storing complex data models than in analyzing large data. For future research, it is suggested to add other comparison aspects such as memory and CPU usage. The researchers can also consider using query optimization techniques to enrich query experiments. \u00a9 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

      "Digital photos are often defined as personal archives collected long ago and are stored on a large enough storage media such as an external hard disk or flash disk. Problems arise when someone wants to find photos of themselves or others in tons of photo collections. Searching manually, such as opening a photo file or folder one by one, will certainly be very troublesome. Based on these problems, this study designed an application for searching certain photos based on the similarity of the inserted face photo. This application is built for computer or laptop devices, which was developed by using the Python programming language and Dlib module that applied the face recognition method through the combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), FaceNet Embedding, and Triplet Loss for matching faces. The recognition scheme starts from face detection, face alignment, face encoding, and face classification stage. Our application is very handy to run in looking for particular face images on external storage compared to prior studies. We have done experimental research, demonstrating that the application can find almost all image files the user is looking for. In addition to the result in the form of an application, this study contributes to exploring the performance of the Dlib module, in terms of precision and recall rate, which could not recognize non-frontal face images well. We encourage other researchers to address this limitation in further studies. \u00a9 2022",

      "In the early phase of the Covid-19 outbreak, all aspects of life, including the culinary sector, were impacted very hard by this outbreak in addition to the existing tight competition. Many businesses were in danger of going bankrupt. However, there was a culinary brand that continued to make an expansion in Bandung, Indonesia. There are seven branches opened by this brand until 2021. Hence, it is interesting to study the phenomena. This study aims to determine the effect of product innovation on the competitive advantage of this culinary brand. Besides this, the customers\u2019 evaluation regarding product innovation and competitive advantage is revealed by this study as well. This research uses a quantitative method by surveying with the purposive sampling technique. The questionnaires were distributed to 100 customers who had made transactions more than once within the last six months before the survey began. The descriptive data analysis was carried out to investigate the customers\u2019 evaluation. It is examined that product innovation has a positive impact on the competitive advantage after a simple linear regression analysis was conducted. This result is strengthened by the t-test that shows the acceptance of the hypothesis. Moreover, the coefficient of determination test presents that the impact of product innovation on competitive advantage is 51 percent. It means that the product innovation has provided 51 percent of the information needed to predict the competitive advantage in this small culinary business. From the overall results of the descriptive analysis, the consumer assessment scores obtained fall into the medium to high category range. This result proves that the response given to the company\u2019s competitive advantage and product innovation is still quite good and positive. The result of this study is expected can inspire other culinary companies to survive their businesses during a difficult situation like the Covid-19 outbreak and to sustain for the future.

      "The number of data service customers is expected to rise exponentially in Indonesia starting in 2021, making the current 4G cellular service quality inadequate. Therefore, before deploying 5G New Radio (NR), it is crucial to prepare the simulations to understand its performance. This can be done by determining the Maximum Allowable Path Loss (MAPL) and obtaining the signal strength level from the Synchronization Signal-Reference Signal Received Power (SS-RSRP) and the signal quality level from the Synchronization Signal-Signal Interference Noise Ratio (SS-SINR) of the mid-band 3.5 GHz frequency. This research aims to determine these values and simulate the results using a commercial network simulator software, Forsk Atoll V3.4, across the whole 52.38 square kilo-meters of dense-urban and the main economic area of Indonesia, Central Jakarta. An urban macro (UMa) propagation model based on the 3GPP TR 38.901 standard is utilized for uplink and downlink circumstances, each employing an Outdoor-to-Outdoor (O2O) Line of Sight (LOS) and a Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) scheme. The average values of the SS-RSRP and SS-SINR in the LOS scheme are -104.71 and 8.8 dB, respectively. Meanwhile, in the NLOS scheme, the SS-RSRP and SS-SINR average values are -87.03 dBm and 10.48 dB, respectively. The NLOS scheme shows superior performance than the LOS scheme. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Municipal waste management has become a challenging issue with the rise in urban pop-ulations and changes in people\u2019s habits, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, government policy plays an important role associated with municipal waste management. Thus, this research proposes the regional location routing problem (RLRP) model and multi-depot regional location routing problem (MRLRP) model, which are extensions of the location routing problem (LRP), to provide a better municipal waste collection process. The model is constructed to cover the minimum number of depot facilities\u2019 policy requirements for each region due to government policy, i.e., the large-scale social restrictions in each region. The goal is to determine the depot locations in each region and the vehicles\u2019 routes for collecting waste to fulfill inter-regional independent needs at a minimum total cost. This research conducts numerical examples with actual data to illustrate the model and implements a hybrid genetic algorithm and simulated annealing optimization to solve the problem. The results show that the proposed method efficiently solves the RLRP and MRLRP. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

      "The waste produced by hospitals is broadly divided into medical waste and non-medical waste. Non-medical waste is generated from activities in hospitals outside of medical, which comes from kitchens, offices, parks, and yards that can be reused or destroyed. In addition to being a health facility, hospitals can also cause negative impacts, one of which is the waste they produce. These negative impacts include the place of disease transmission, causing environmental pollution and health problems. Many general hospitals still do not have an integrated non-medical waste management system that supports green hospitals. The non-medical waste management process, from the preparation to reporting stages, is still done manually. This manual process can cause several problems, such as non-medical waste monitoring, which cannot be done regularly, and the recording of the waste generated and the waste that has been managed is prone to errors. To support green hospitals in public hospitals, it is necessary to manage the waste generated by hospitals in an integrated manner to facilitate monitoring, reporting, and evaluation. This research will focus on designing and developing a non-medical waste management module using an ERP system that will integrate it with other elements, such as inventory, to make it easier for public hospitals to classify processed waste in storage warehouses. Not only that, but this system will simplify the preparation process for management, help determine the amount of waste generated, and can be monitored through non-medical waste indicators, which are then reported in the form of documents, making it easier for companies to analyze results and assist in further decision making.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "The sequential labeling model is commonly used for time series or sequence data where each instance label is classified using previous instance label. In this work, a sequential labeling model is proposed as a new approach to detect the type and index mutations simultaneously, using DNA sequences from lung cancer study cases. The methods used are One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU). Each nucleotide in the patient's DNA sequence is classified as either normal or with a certain type of mutation in which case, its index mutation is predicted. The mutation types detected are either substitution, insertion, deletion, or delins (deletion insertion) mutations. Based on the experiments that were conducted using EGFR gene, BiLSTM and Bi-GRU displayed better performance and were more stable than 1D-CNN. Further tests were carried out on the TP53, KRAS, CTNNB1, SMARCA4, CDKN2A, PTPRD, BRAF, ERBB2, and PTPRT gene. The proposed model reports F1-scores of 0.9596, and 0.9612 using Bi-GRU and BiLSTM, respectively. Based on the results the model can successfully detect the type and index mutations in the DNA sequence more accurately and faster without the need for other supporting data and tools, and does not require re-alignment to reference sequences. This will greatly facilitate the user in detecting type and index mutations faster by entering only the DNA sequence. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

It is necessary to explore family functions to fill the existing theoretical and practical gap. Therefore, the present study aims to analyze the relationship among family, work engagement, and turnover intention by considering the family as a sources source of both conflict and support. To this end, this study surveyed non-manager and staff-level employees in pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia. Analyzed using SEM covariance procedure with AMOS 23 software, this study found that family plays dual roles in affecting employees\u2019 work engagement. Increased work engagement was found to result in a lower turnover intention yet increasing work-family conflict. Increased sales, working hours, and targets are among the factors leading to work-family conflict. Work engagement is a double-edged sword that should be handled carefully through communication and stress management interventions.

Most smart parking systems have a centralized system, wherein that type of system is at-risk of single-point failure that can affect the whole system. To overcome the weakness of the centralized system, the most popular mechanism that researchers proposed is blockchain. If there is no mechanism implemented in the blockchain to verify the authenticity of every transaction, then the system is not secure against impersonation attacks. This study combines blockchain mechanism with Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) based digital signature for securing the scheme against impersonation and double-spending attacks.

      "Objective: The modality to detect ovarian cancer at an early stage is very limited. Early diagnosis determines the prognosis. This study aimed to develop a risk assessment tool for early detection of ovarian cancer using artificial intelligence. To accomplish this, the presence of ten signs and symptoms reported by patients with ovarian cancer was assessed. Methods: This study was carried out as a cohort study of patients diagnosed with suspected ovarian tumors undergoing cytoreduction operation at Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, from December 2019 to September 2020. Compared to ovarian cancer self-assessment through questionnaire, postoperative histopathology in patients with suspected ovarian tumors. The questionnaire proceeded by artificial intelligence is grouped into risk and no risk. Statistical analyses were done using Chi-Square and Exact Fisher Test. Result: In total, 115 patients included in this study. The differences were statistically significant in terms of the six variables (abdominal bloating, nausea/vomiting, decreased of appetite, fullness, menstrual disturbance, and weight loss) ovarian cancer self-assessment compared to postoperative histopathology with a tendency towards benign ovarian tumors (p<0.05), while there was no statistically significant difference in the four variables (abdominal enlargement, abdominal pain, urinating disturbance, and defecation disturbance) (p>0.05). According to the artificial intelligence grouping, fifty-five patients were at risk, and sixty patients were not at risk. The Fifty-five risk patients were related with postoperative histopathology diagnosis (with RR 0.682 and CI 95% 0.519-0.895). Conclusion: Risk assessments based on ovarian cancer self-assessment unfortunately were not comparable to postoperative histopathology as a single predictor.

      "Glaucoma is an eye disease with special characteristics such as neuropathy optic nerve damage and visual field abnormalities. An increased intraocular pressure is a significant risk factor for glaucoma. Glaucoma is the second largest cause of blindness worldwide, behind cataracts, based on the current World Health Organization (WHO). Ophthalmologists usually detect glaucoma using the Cup to Disc Ratio (CDR) parameter, and manual CDR calculations should be performed by trained doctors and use expensive and relatively limited devices. This research was made to overcome this problem by creating a system that can classify glaucoma through fundus images using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Residual Network-34. A total of 2156 fundus images were used in the research, the data divided into five types of glaucoma: early, moderate, deep, OHT, and normal. The ratio between training against testing data, as well as the effect of utilizing three different optimizers: Adam, SGD, and RMS are investigated in the system testing scenario.

      "Mobile Cognitive Radio Base Station (MCRBS) is a technology to recover network communication temporarily in disaster areas. The communications can be built by constructing the backbone network, where it is formed by connecting multiple MCRBSs with point-to-point radio communication link considering the best routing algorithm. The MCRBS antenna system should has an ability on producing the beam into specific d irection to establish point-to-point radio communication link. However, there is no capable system to support the MCRBS antenna system for directing the beam. Therefore, it requires a system that can assist in focusing the beam of antenna system for the MCRBSs connectivity. In this paper, we propose Rotman Lens that has beamforming capability to support radio backbone communication for multiple MCRBSs connectivity in post-disaster networks. The Rotman Lens is chosen to generate amplitude and phase shift in performing beamforming technique with simultaneous signal transmissions from MCRBS to others without moving the antenna system. In this research, the Rotman Lens was evaluated through a series of computer simulations and laboratory experiments to investigate the lens performance. The final proposed lens provides the experiment results for all beam ports with an average value both return loss and mutual coupling of less than \u221215 dB and \u221220 dB, where the magnitude deviation in average value and the maximum error of phase difference are 1.172 dB and 6.014\u25e6, respectively.

This study focuses on the importance of visibility and accuracy of the information on the coffee supply chain and aims to identify the use of information technology to eliminate problems in the coffee industry, especially in West Java. The study begins by compiling basic assumptions and rules of thought used in research, data collection, data reduction, categorization, analysis, interpretation, and data display, and the conclusion. The data analysis used a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), which was used to determine the representation of critical factors contained in the research dimensions. As a finding the coffee supply chain in West Java has not been responsive and efficient yet, so improvements need to be made to get high added value for regional economic growth. The results of the study also identified several obstacles along the supply chain and solution based on a high level of information accuracy with several challenges to utilize it, namely (1) data and information sharing, (2) forecasting optimization, and (3) collaborative planning.

The Baduy community represents self-governance in Banten Province, where they highly uphold the customs handed down from their ancestors. The Simanau people in West Sumatra Province can manage forest resources well and apply severe penalties for those who violate their rules. The Rumbio community in Riau Province is sage in managing the customary prohibition forest. The self-governance that has been implemented so far has gone quite well. By regulation, the applied self-governance does not conflict with the formal rules that apply in Indonesia. This paper is a reflection that humans can live in harmony with nature. \u00a9 2022",

      "The Indo-Australian Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Pacific Plate all converge where Indonesia is situated. As a result, Indonesia is a nation where earthquakes occur frequently. Some researchers have studied machine learning algorithms for categorizing earthquake vibrations. In this experiment, earthquake vibrations are categorized using the Artificial Neural Network method. We need appropriate datasets to obtain the maximum accuracy from the artificial neural network technique. The findings of this experiment show that feature extraction is required for the datasets to be trained to obtain a high accuracy value. The mean, median, maximum, minimum, skew, and kurtosis values are the feature that are extracted. In addition to employing feature extraction, it is crucial to modify the algorithm model. The experimental setup that uses 'sigmoid' activation on the input layer, the three hidden layers, and the output layer yields the best accuracy when all feature are extracted, with training to test ratio of 90% to 10%. This is demonstrated by the exceptional training accuracy and testing accuracy values, which are 99.85 percent for training accuracy and 99.12 percent for validation accuracy. The mean value yields the highest accuracy result compared to employing just one feature extraction. Only 90.97 and 90.37 percent of training and validation accuracy are obtained when the mean is used alone for feature extraction.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

This data has become an opportunity to evaluate and improve the lecture preparation process already running. Data processing is needed to gain knowledge from the event log, one of which is process mining. This study starts from the discovery stage to conformance checking. Before the process mining is carried out, pre-processing of the data will be carried out to produce good quality logs and define the case id, activity, and timestamp. Existing event logs will be processed using ProM tools using the Heuristic Miner Algorithm to model the process and achieve the best fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity values. The Heuristic Miner algorithm was adopted in this study because of its capability to manage event logs with noise and display the primary behavior of existing business processes. The conformance checking result shows a fitness value of 0.98, precision's value of 0.29, generalization's value of 0.51, and simplicity's value of 0.45 for the lecture preparation process.

      "A Single-band Series Absorptive Common Mode Noise Filter (ACMF) is proposed. The ACMF is embedded in a four-layer printed circuit board (PCB) and consists of three parts: a Reflective Common Mode Noise Filter (RCMF), a matching circuit, and an absorber. The RCMF is designed using mushroom-type resonators. The matching circuit is designed using meander lines to reduce the size of the filter dimensions. The absorber of the Common Mode noise (CM) is a series resistor. The designed operating frequency is 2.45 GHz. The simulation results are as follows: the insertion loss of CM (Scc21) is \u221222.49 dB at the frequency of 2.61 GHz, the return loss of CM (Scc11) is \u221218.62 dB at the frequency of 2.5 GHz, while the integrity of the Differential Mode signals (DM) can be maintained with a very small insertion loss (Sdd21) of \u22121 dB at the frequency range of 0-8 GHz, and the achieved Absorption Efficiency (AE) is 93% at the frequency of 2.54 GHz. The proposed ACMF dimension is 10.3 x4.6 mm. The fractional bandwidth is 19%. The measurement results of the fabricated ACMF do not deviate significantly the simulation results. They are as follows: Scc21is \u221217.87 dB at the frequency of 2.31 GHz, Scc11 is \u221220.87 dB at the frequency of 2.38 GHz, Sdd21is \u22122.8 dB at the frequency range of 0\u20138 GHz, the Absorption Efficiency is 97% at the frequency of 2.32 GHz, and the fractional bandwidth is 17%.

      "A Single-band Series Absorptive Common Mode Noise Filter (ACMF) is proposed. The ACMF is embedded in a four-layer printed circuit board (PCB) and consists of three parts: a Reflective Common Mode Noise Filter (RCMF), a matching circuit, and an absorber. The RCMF is designed using mushroom-type resonators. The matching circuit is designed using meander lines to reduce the size of the filter dimensions. The absorber of the Common Mode noise (CM) is a series resistor. The designed operating frequency is 2.45 GHz. The simulation results are as follows: the insertion loss of CM (Scc21) is \u221222.49 dB at the frequency of 2.61 GHz, the return loss of CM (Scc11) is \u221218.62 dB at the frequency of 2.5 GHz, while the integrity of the Differential Mode signals (DM) can be maintained with a very small insertion loss (Sdd21) of \u22121 dB at the frequency range of 0-8 GHz, and the achieved Absorption Efficiency (AE) is 93% at the frequency of 2.54 GHz. The proposed ACMF dimension is 10.3 x4.6 mm. The fractional bandwidth is 19%. The measurement results of the fabricated ACMF do not deviate significantly the simulation results. They are as follows: Scc21is \u221217.87 dB at the frequency of 2.31 GHz, Scc11 is \u221220.87 dB at the frequency of 2.38 GHz, Sdd21is \u22122.8 dB at the frequency range of 0\u20138 GHz, the Absorption Efficiency is 97% at the frequency of 2.32 GHz, and the fractional bandwidth is 17%. Therefore, the results of the ACMF design carried out by simulation can be implemented into a fabricated ACMF with measurement results similar to the calculation results in the design. \u00a9 ACES."

      "The performance of a needle tungsten corona-discharge charger (NTCC) as a neutralizer in an electrospray aerosol generator (EAG) is compared to that of a surface-discharge micro-plasma aerosol charger (SMAC). We demonstrate the performance of an EAG with a reduction chamber that consists of a neutralizer. The ion produced by the neutralizer is characterized by measuring its ion properties utilizing an ion counter, a Faraday cup electrometer, and a mini-cyDMA. Both the SMAC and NTCC have balanced bipolar ions with ion concentration ratios of 0.95 and 1.07, respectively. While the diffusivity of the positive ions produced by the NTCC is more significant than that of the SMAC, it is the opposite for negative ions. The EAG system is evaluated by optimizing the EAG orifice diameter and carrier airflow rate. It was found that a maximum singly charged electrosprayed particle could be achieved at an orifice diameter and a carrier airflow rate of 10 mm and 1 L min\u22121, respectively. The performance of charge reduction is determined by a multiply to singly charged ratio. The NTCC neutralizer dramatically reduced the highly charged electrosprayed particle to below 10 elementary charges. In brief, the result shows that the NTCC performs better than the SMAC in reducing multiply charged particles.

      "Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is a type of brain disorder caused by dopaminergic neuron loss. People with Parkinson's disease have symptoms such as tremors and stiffness which caused the affected people difficulty to control their movement. The diagnosis of PD is usually based on measures neurologist analyses of medical history, review of the symptoms, neurological and physical examination. Therefore, it requires along procedure to identify Parkinson's disease and considerable risk of misdiagnosis. This study proposes automatic detection of Parkinson\u2019s disease formed on gait analysis of Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) signals. The raw data of VGRF signals obtained from the Physionet database is filtered using a Butterworth high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.8\u00a0Hz. Afterward, the features were used based on the maximum amplitude value, the minimum amplitude value, and the maximum power value of VGRF signals after filtering. K-Nearest Neighbor was performed as a classifier to classify PD and healthy subjects. The total data used are 165 data that consists of 93 PD and 72 healthy subjects. The proposed model was evaluated using 42 test datasets and obtained a 77% AUC score by using the most optimal parameter of K-NN with K = 7 and Chebyshev as a distance matrix. The performance of accuracy and AUC score obtained in classification was acceptable even though only used 3 features as input for the KNN classifier model. In addition, the proposed method simplifies the previous algorithm in detecting Parkinson's disease. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is very important; hence it can provide the proper treatments that can delay the disease progression. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

      "Determine the state feedback controller gain in the LQR controller is quite challenging as it requires multiple attempts of trial and error process. To eliminate the trial and error method when selecting the optimal controller parameter, we propose a PSO-based state feedback controller for the active suspension system. It is an intelligent-based method to determine state feedback gain controller by employing optimization technique using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Unlike optimization-based LQR controller which seek the optimum Q and R matrices and then calculate the LQR feedback gain, in this study, the PSO algorithm is used to determine feedback gain controller parameters directly. In addition to the simple and straightforward controller design approach, the proposed controller is designed to obtain the optimum state feedback gain for improving both ride comfort and road handling aspects simultaneously by employing a multi-objective optimization technique. The proposed controller is applied on a quarter-car active suspension model. The controller performance is evaluated using Performance Index value based on the response of the suspension system under different road excitation, i.e. bump road profile and sinusoidal road profile at the frequency range from 1 to 10\u00a0Hz.

      "Determine the state feedback controller gain in the LQR controller is quite challenging as it requires multiple attempts of trial and error process. To eliminate the trial and error method when selecting the optimal controller parameter, we propose a PSO-based state feedback controller for the active suspension system. It is an intelligent-based method to determine state feedback gain controller by employing optimization technique using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Unlike optimization-based LQR controller which seek the optimum Q and R matrices and then calculate the LQR feedback gain, in this study, the PSO algorithm is used to determine feedback gain controller parameters directly. In addition to the simple and straightforward controller design approach, the proposed controller is designed to obtain the optimum state feedback gain for improving both ride comfort and road handling aspects simultaneously by employing a multi-objective optimization technique.

In this paper, we revisit classification algorithm and then recommend the group-based classification. The proposed modified algorithm, which is called as Group Class Residual Sparse Representation-based Classification (GCR-SRC), extends the coherency of the test sample to the whole training samples of the identified class rather than only to the nearest one of the training samples. Our method is based on the nearest coherency between a test sample and the identified training samples.

This method is selected to reduce the computational cost without increasing the algorithm\u2019s complexity. From the simulation result, the reduction factor ((Formula presented.)) 64 can achieve a maximum recognition rate about 10% higher than the SRC original using the downscaling method. Our proposed method\u2019s feasibility and effectiveness are tested on four popular face databases, namely AT&T, Yale B, Georgia Tech, and AR Dataset. GCR-SRC and GCR-RP-SRC achieved up to 4% more accurate than SRC random projection with class-specific residuals.

Visible Light Communication (VLC), a subset of optical communication systems, can potentially be a solution or even a replacement for radio frequency technology. VLC has various Multiple Access Techniques, one of which is non-orthogonal multiple access, commonly called NOMA. In optical communication, the signal transmitted through the communication channel will always experience changes due to interference from outside and customers who are always moving and sometimes away from the transmitter.

The research in this final project shows that the number and location of users in the NOMA VLC Adaptive Power Control technique affect the average value data rate and the average gain value achieved.

      "In this study, a smart Ubiquitous Geometry (Smart-UG) system with smart mechanisms support was developed to facilitate learners\u2019 geometry learning through measuring objects in authentic context. Further, we designed a real-time collaborative measuring function based on the augmented reality (AR) in the mobile device. Learners were required to measure objects collaboratively with their peers, calculate the surface area and perimeter of the objects in authentic contexts, and discuss. In order to facilitate meaningful collaboration, interaction and socialization among peers, we designed the smart mechanisms that provided learners with a way to ask others for help if they face difficulty. Participants were fifth-grade learners from two classes that were assigned into different groups. The experimental group (EG) consists of 26 learners and the control group (CG) consists of 26 learners with/without smart mechanisms support, respectively. The results revealed that EG with assistance of smart mechanisms like peer help significantly improved geometry ability and got higher scores than CG. In addition, EG who completed more practices, made fewer mistakes, and asked others for help had a better understanding of geometry concepts. Moreover, learners showed a positive attitude and high intention toward Smart-UG. Therefore, our Smart-UG with the smart mechanism support could facilitate learners to learn geometry smartly in authentic context and enhance their geometry ability. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

      "One critical problem in Indonesia's national joint courses program, initiated by the ministry of education and culture of Indonesia, is the lecturer-course assignment problem. Although the lecturer-course assignmentproblem has been studied widely as part of the education timetabling problem, no existing lecturer-courseassignment model suits this circumstance. The new cases in this program are as follows. First, this program isconducted online. Second, the participants are students and lecturers from different universities. Based on thisproblem, this work proposes a novel lecturer-course assignment model that suits this program. The lecturers'preferred courses and timeslots become hard constraints. The model has three objectives: (1) maximizing theeducational quality, (2) maximizing the lecturers' time preference, and (3) minimizing the number of unservedclasses. This model is developed by using integer linear programming and optimized by using cloud theory-basedsimulated annealing. This proposed model is then compared with the four previous lecturers-course assignmentmodels. The first model concerns about minimizing the number of unserved classes, while the second model focuseson maximizing the education quality. The maximum number of classes per course for every lecturer is considered inthe third model while balancing the lecturer\u2019s load (teach, research, community service) is the feature of the fourthmodel. The research concludes that the proposed model is appropriate for lecture-course assignment in Indonesia\u2019snational joint courses program compared to the previous models.

We propose a nonlinear model that represents the allowable RF input amplitude within the MZM transmission boundary area. We investigate the maximum RF input amplitude and confine its harmonics using nonlinear model theory, RoF simulation, and MZM characteristic experiments. The maximum RF input amplitude in the MZM transmission boundary area is a convenient technique that can confine harmonics without an optical amplifier, optical filter, or other optical devices in RoF links. We select several RF input amplitudes within the MZM boundary area and account for harmonic distortion in the investigation. The RF input amplitude is 0.8 times of the EO modulator switching voltages. The boundary areas show that near the switching voltage value, the harmonics-to-main RF ratio (HMR) is less than 10%. Furthermore, the maximum RF inputs are still appropriate for QPSK modulation. We evaluate the nonlinear model of these modulation signals in terms of the error vector magnitude and constellation diagram. After considering the optical fiber impairment, thermal noise, and harmonics distortion in the nonlinear model with the modulation signal of QPSK, the ACLR and EVMs satisfy the 3GPP specification.

Design/methodology/approach: Snowball sampling was performed to arrive at a representative group of Millennials. Data analysis was performed using hierarchical likelihood via structural equation modeling. Findings: The study results are helpful for a comprehensive understanding of factors affecting visit intention. Effects of the study results sum-mary, tourists from Generations Y and Z are thriving within the internet of things and the digital age, an era in which information can be accessed via various forms of technology across multiple platforms. Practical implications: We discuss and identify the relative importance of each factor through the use of logistics with variational approximation and structural equation models using hierarchical likelihood. Originality: The technique we use is an integrated and extended version of the structural equation model with hierarchical likelihood estimation and features selection using logistics variational approximation. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

      "Hypertension is a severe public health issue worldwide that significantly increases the risk of cardiac vascular disease, stroke, brain hemorrhage, and renal dysfunction. Early screening of blood pressure (BP) levels is essential to prevent the dangerous complication associated with hypertension as the leading cause of death. Recent studies have focused on employing photoplethysmograms (PPG) with machine learning to classify BP levels. However, several studies claimed that electrocardiograms (ECG) also strongly correlate with blood pressure. Therefore, we proposed a concatenated convolutional neural network which integrated the features extracted from PPG and ECG signals. This study used the MIMIC III dataset, which provided PPG, ECG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. A total of 14,298 signal segments were obtained from 221 patients, which were divided into 9150 signals of train data, 2288 signals of validation data, and 2860 signals of test data. In the training process, five-fold cross-validation was applied to select the best model with the highest classification performance. The proposed concatenated CNN architecture using PPG and ECG obtained the highest test accuracy of 94.56\u201395.15% with a 95% confidence interval in classifying BP levels into hypotension, normotension, prehypertension, hypertension stage 1, and hypertension stage 2.

The population using the internet also experienced an increase during the period 2016\u2013 2020, as indicated by the increasing percentage of the population accessing the internet in 2016 from around 25.37 percent to 53.73 percent in 2020. This study led to a review of the level of ICT vulnerability in eastern Indonesia through a machine learning-based cluster analysis approach. Implications: Data were collected in this study from Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) through SUSENAS to obtain an overview of the socioeconomic level and SAKERNAS to capture the employment side. This study uses 15 variables based on aspects of business vulnerability covering 174 districts/cities. Practical implications: Cluster analysis using Fuzzy C Means (FCM) was used to obtain a profile of ICT level vulnerability in eastern Indonesia by selecting the best model.

Data mining is the process of extracting large amounts of information from data by collecting, using data, the history of data relationship patterns, and relationships in large data sets. Support Vector Regression has the advantage of making accurate cryptocurrency price predictions and can overcome the problem of overfitting by itself. Polkadot is one of the cryptocurrencies that are often used as investment instruments in the world of cryptocurrencies. Polkadot cryptocurrency price prediction analysis using the Support Vector Regression algorithm has a good predictive accuracy value, including for Polkadot daily closing price data, namely with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel with cost parameters C = 1000 and gamma = 0.001 obtained model accuracy of 90.00% and MAPE of 5.28 while for linear kernels with parameters C = 10 obtained an accuracy of 87.68% with a MAPE value of 6.10.

      "Face mask detection and recognition have been incorporated into many applications in daily life, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate the spread of coronavirus, wearing face masks has become commonplace. However, traditional face detection and recognition systems utilize main facial features such as the mouth, nose, and eyes to determine a person\u2019s identity. Masks make facial detection and recognition tasks more challenging since certain parts of the face are concealed. Yet, how to improve the performance of existing systems with a face mask overlaid on the original face input images remains an open area of inquiry. In this study, we propose an improved face mask-aware recognition system named \u2018MAR\u2019 based on deep learning, which can tackle challenges in face mask detection and recognition. MAR consists of five main modules to handle various kinds of input images. We re-train the CenterNet model with our augmented face mask inputs to perform face mask detection and propose four variations on face mask recognition models based on the pre-trained ArcFace to handle facial recognition. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models on the VGGFACE2 dataset and achieve a high accuracy score on both detection and recognition tasks. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

      "On-grid solar power system, the process of synchronizing the voltage, phase, and frequency between the solar panels and the voltage distributed by the State Electricity Company (PLN) is essential. Synchronous conditions are indispensable for the operation of power plants in parallel. This study aims to design an on-grid inverter that converts the DC voltage from solar power plants to AC voltage, namely PLN\u2019s specification, which can produce output in sinusoidal waves with the voltage of 220V and a frequency of 50 Hz according to the PLN network. The method used in this research is the zero-crossing technique, which is a technique to determine the zero point of a single-phase power source, namely PLN.

      "On-grid solar power system, the process of synchronizing the voltage, phase, and frequency between the solar panels and the voltage distributed by the State Electricity Company (PLN) is essential. Synchronous conditions are indispensable for the operation of power plants in parallel. This study aims to design an on-grid inverter that converts the DC voltage from solar power plants to AC voltage, namely PLN\u2019s specification, which can produce output in sinusoidal waves with the voltage of 220V and a frequency of 50 Hz according to the PLN network. The method used in this research is the zero-crossing technique, which is a technique to determine the zero point of a single-phase power source, namely PLN. These zero points will activate the microcontroller PWM and the formation of SPWM for the inverter switch can be generated.

      "Purpose: The study aims to analyze the influence of hedonic, utilitarian, and self-esteem motivations on online shopping behavior. Likewise, the mediating role of impulsive shopping and shopping intentions is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: The study was carried out with the results of a survey in which 450 respondents participated, and the data was analyzed by using structural equation modeling (SmartPLS 3.0 software). Findings: All the hypothesized links were significant and positive except for the relationship of self-esteem motive with impulsive shopping tendency, which was negative as hypothesized. Moreover, hedonic motive had a strong positive impact on impulsive shopping tendency, whereas, in contrast, utilitarian motive had a strong positive impact on shopping intentions. Practical implications: Managers should focus on functional value rather than emotional value to attract customers who tend to be utilitarian. In contrast, for customers who tend to be hedonic, the product offerings should be visually appealing, stimulating and inspiring, as well as have emotional value. Originality/value: This study investigates the roles of self-esteem and hedonic motives in impulsive shopping behavior. Moreover, by using the theory of planned behavior, this study highlights the roles of hedonic and utilitarian motives in attitude toward engaging in online shopping. \u00a9 2022, Indrawati Indrawati, Gadang Ramantoko, Tri Widarmanti, Izzatdin Abdul Aziz and Farhat Ullah Khan.",

      "Accurate forecasting of electricity load is essential for electricity companies, primarily for planning electricity generators. Overestimated or underestimated forecasting value may lead to inefficiency of electricity generator or electricity deficiency in the electricity grid system. Parameters that may affect electricity demand are the weather conditions at the location of the electricity system. In this paper, we investigate possible weather parameters that affect electricity load. As a case study, we choose an area with an isolated electricity system, i.e., Bali Island, in Indonesia. We calculate correlations of various weather parameters with electricity load in Bali during the period 2018\u20132019. We use two machine learning models to design an electricity load forecasting system, i.e., the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using features from various weather parameters. We design scenarios that add one-by-one weather parameters to investigate which weather parameters affect the electricity load. The results show that the weather parameter with the highest correlation value with the electricity load in Bali is the temperature, which is then followed by sun radiation and wind speed parameter. We obtain the best prediction with GRNN and SVR with a correlation coefficient value of 0.95 and 0.965, respectively. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

      "The heart sound coming from the patient is observed using a stethoscope, which is a medical tool to determine the patient's condition. The technique for this observation is called auscultation. This sound describes the condition of a person's heart. Because auscultation relies on the experience and knowledge of doctors, various methods for analyzing heart sounds are automatically developed by researchers. In this study, a method for classifying normal heart sounds and murmurs is proposed using the grey-level difference matrix (GLDM) feature taken from the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) plot. The STFT plot is converted into an image then the GLDM characteristics are calculated as input for the support vector machine as a classification. The experimental result shows that the highest accuracy of 83% is achieved using STFT 200-100 in four directions of GLDM. Even though this accuracy is not as high as the previous research, the proposed method is still open for exploration, such as distance selection in GLDM or other image analysis methods. \u00a9 2022 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

      "Cloud gaming is one of the developments of Cloud Computing services, namely Game as a Service. In its application, all computing system processes pass through the internet network that connects one computer device to another simultaneously. The concept of cloud gaming allows a game not to be installed on a computer device first. The game on the server will be streamed to the player's screen, and it facilitates those who want to play games with higher specifications than the device. In this research, the author was implementing cloud gaming on client devices. The analysis included resource usage and QoS from the cloud gaming concept applied to client computers using the Styx: Shards of Darkness and Peaky Blinders: Mastermind for testing a GameQoo's platform performance based on ITU-T G.1010 interactive games standard. Based on the testing, it was concluded that GameQoo's cloud gaming could run well on both laptop devices and have a good performance. For the resource usage test, the maximum average was 9.98% for CPU usage, 13.05% for RAM usage, and 99.49 FPS. For the QoS test, the maximum average was 6.43 ms when the bandwidth was 4 Mbps. The generated maximum delay average was 67.51 ms when the bandwidth was 4 Mbps. Limited bandwidth will caused jitter and delay getting bigger. The produced maximum throughput value was 4.426,85 Kbps.

Therefore, this paper studies the comparison of OMP, LASSO, and CVX to help the readers understand the reconstruction algorithm's effect on SRC. The simulation result is that LASSO and CVX algorithms have the same recognition rate, but LASSO can compute twice faster as CVX.

      "The prime objective of this study is to investigate the role of microfinance institutions towards women's self-sustainability in Pakistan because women are the most vulnerable community in Pakistan and in the world, too. Due to various issues like gender discrimination, women's self-sustainability is quite low, and this accounts for the negligible contribution of women in Pakistan's economy (up to 20 to 25%). In addressing this issue, the current study adopted a quantitative research approach and cross-sectional research design. By using a survey questionnaire, data were collected from female clients of microfinance institutions during May 1, 2018 to August 30, 2018. SmartPLS 3 was utilized to analyse the data. The results of the inquiry revealed that microfinance institutions have an essential role to play in promoting women's self-reliance. With the help of micro-enterprises for women, services offered by microfinance institution such as micro-credit, micro-savings, micro-insurance, micro-training and social capital have a major role in developing women's self-sustainability. However, an environmental disaster is one of the crucial factors, which limits the positive contribution of microfinance institutions towards women's self-sustainability. Our thorough research and knowledge on the subject indicates that the current study is the pioneer study that has investigated microfinance institutions as major facilitators of women's self-reliance but which has been limited by many factors such as environmental disasters.

We simulated and analyzed the effect of Matched Filter on the distance between transmitter and receiver in a closed room. The information signal as bits has been modulated using on-off keying Non return to zero (OOK-NRZ) modulation before entering the Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights to be transmitted. The photodiode captured the light and converted it to an electrical signal. We employed SDD to enhance the decoding process from received signals. We consider several parameters to compare performance without a matched filter using a 100 Mbps bit-rate, the number of bits is 1 million bits, and the room size is 3x3x5 m. Also, we evaluated performance using signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) to compare decoding in the receiver. From the extensive simulation, the results show that maximum receiver coverage is 0.1414 m2 for direct decoding. When the matched filter system is added, we found that the coverage area increases to 0.7697 m2. In addition, SDD using matched filter has an improvement of around 43.5% in terms of coverage, so massive sensors are able to serve optimally. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "One common type of vascular dementia (VaD) is poststroke dementia (PSD). Vascular dementia can occur in one-third of stroke patients. The worsening of cognitive function can occur quickly if not detected and treated early. One of the potential medical modalities for observing this disorder by considering costs and safety factors is electroencephalogram (EEG). It is thought that there are differences in the spectral dynamics of the EEG signal between the normal group and stroke patients with cognitive impairment so that it can be used in detection. Therefore, this study proposes an EEG signal characterization method using EEG spectral power complexity measurements to obtain features of poststroke patients with cognitive impairment and normal subjects. Working memory EEGs were collected and analyzed from forty-two participants, consisting of sixteen normal subjects, fifteen poststroke patients with mild cognitive impairment, and eleven poststroke patients with dementia. From the analysis results, it was found that there were differences in the dynamics of the power spectral in each group, where the spectral power of the cognitively impaired group was more regular than the normal group. Notably, (1) significant differences in spectral entropy (SpecEn) with a p value <0.05 were found for all electrodes, (2) there was a relationship between SpecEn values and the severity of dementia (SpecEnDem < SpecEnMCI < SpecEnNormal), and (3) a post hoc multiple comparison test showed significant differences between groups at the F7 electrode. This study shows that spectral complexity analysis can discriminate between normal and poststroke patients with cognitive impairment. For further studies, it is necessary to simulate performance validation so that the proposed approach can be used in the early detection of poststroke dementia and monitoring the development of dementia.  \u00a9 2022 Sugondo Hadiyoso et al.",

A cross-sectional study design was conducted from January to March 2020 in Bantul District, Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia. Data were collected using questionnaires from 369 females in reproductive age. The sample size was calculated using the Slovin formula with a 95% confidence level from 4,869 women of childbearing age. Using path analysis, it revealed that high intention had a direct effect on contraceptive use behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and self-efficacy have indirect effects on contraceptive use through intention. Knowledge had an indirect effect through self-efficacy and level of education through knowledge. Initiatives related to increasing contraceptive use behavior are needed to reduce the risk of unmet need. Furthermore, the results of this study can be used by stakeholders to formulate strategies in an effort to encourage family planning practices. \u00a9 2022.

Steganography techniques are used so that message protection or hiding secret messages does not raise suspicion for the attacker. The most commonly used steganographic embedding method is the least significant bit with image media. Current technological developments and advances make many different color spaces. However, it is not yet known the best color space for steganographic images in digital images. In this study, the performance and image quality of the eight best color spaces were compared, namely RGB, HSV, HSI, XYZ, LAB, YIQ, YUV, and YCbCr. The images used as experiments in this study are pictures of lena and baboons. The comparison results obtained with the evaluation criteria of image quality with eight measurement methods, namely NAE, NCC, MSE, PSNR, AD, MD, SC, and SSIM. Resulting that the image in the Hue Saturation Value (HSV) color space has better performance than other color spaces.

When the product meets the needs of the user, it can be said that the product is of high quality and vice versa, when the user is not satisfied with the product, it can be said that the product is of low quality. Based on the survey, e-recruitment websites still have problems related to complicated user flow, less user-friendly designs and lack of learnability. Currently creating software with quality that can meet user needs is a challenge for the software development team. The researchers propose Design Thinking as a solution to these problems because it can create a solution-oriented analysis that is carried out repeatedly. However, Design Thinking lacks project management techniques. On the other hand, some studies combine the concept of Design Thinking with Scrum to address the shortcomings of Design Thinking. However, the process in Scrum often creates a series of deadlines and iterations that reduce software quality, cost and time due to decreased Development Performance. To prove this, this study will conduct an analysis related to Product Quality and Development Performance from the merger of these concepts.

The VF is proposed as a motion planning method for a Hypersonic Flight Vehicle (HFV) due to its light computation which utilizes the Lyapunov method and simple geometric approach (i.e., line and orbital). The proposed control design is tested using MATLAB, and the simulation is tested using FlightGear. MATLAB is used for system modeling and control design, while FlightGear is used as the simulator. The results show that the VF method can guide the HFV to the desired path. It is shown that HFV velocity affects the designed parameters. The greater velocity will require a smaller value of k. However, the smaller value of k leads to a longer rise time of error value on Y-Axis. It is obtained that the fallowing value of $k10^{\\wedge}(-6)$, $10^{\\wedge}(-5), 10^{\\wedge}(-4)$, and $10^{\\wedge}(-3)$ results in the rise time of error value on Y-axis are 1127 second, 109.4 seconds, 6.8 seconds (oscillate), and- seconds (oscillate), respectively. \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

      "Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is one of the key technologies to achieving higher speeds, lower latency, and less energy. D2D communication is direct link communication between two communication devices, meaning that communication can occur without going through the base station. However, because communication occurs without going through the base station and D2D users do not have their resources, D2D users simultaneously use the resources owned by Cellular User Equipment (CUE) to communicate and cause interference. Power allocation is optimized to mitigate the interference between D2D users and CUEs and maximize the system's overall sum rate. The traditional power allocation scheme in D2D communication still has problems related to the efficiency of the allocation, coordination of interference, and limitations for operating in real-time systems. This work focuses on designing the Long Short Term Memory with Fully Convolutional Network (LSTM-FCN) algorithm suitable for the power control problem on a D2D underlay communication system with an uplink-side multi-cell scheme. The simulation results show that enhancement of CUE can increase the system's sum rate and energy efficiency. At the same time, enhancement of the D2D pair can also increase the sum rate but decrease energy efficiency. Both LSTM-FCN, LSTM, and FCN can approximate the performance of the conventional scheme (CA-based algorithm). Besides that, LSTM-FCN gets the smallest time complexity compared to the other two algorithms and gets the closest performance to CA in both scenarios above 97% accuracy.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Various variants of COVID-19 have entered Indonesia, such as the delta and the omicron variants. The delta variant has a higher severity than the omicron variant, but the transmission rate for the omicron variant is much faster. The government encourages citizens to get booster vaccines to reduce the effect of the delta and omicron variants. The booster vaccine produced a better effect on citizens than on people who received only the two doses. Therefore, in this study, we observe the transmission of COVID-19 and the vaccine locations on the sub-districts level using the clustering approach. The data we use are COVID-19 positive cases, died, treated, and self-isolated cases. Meanwhile, the vaccination data are 1st dose, 2nd doses, stage 3 of 1st dose, and stage 3 of 2nd doses. The Dunn Index and Hubert Index methods determined the best number of clusters before the clustering process. Silhouette and Davies Bouldin are used to find better clustering between Fuzzy C-Means, K-Means, and Partition Around Medoids (PAM). The results obtained from this study showed that the K-Means method was the best with the best number of clusters, namely 3. Jagakarsa and Kebon Jeruk entered high levels at the time of the delta variant due to the COVID-19 case and vaccination spread. However, Jagakarsa and Kebon Jeruk dropped to the intermediate level during the omicron variant. The benefit of this study is to help the government pay more attention to high COVID-19 cases and low vaccine distribution.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

Therefore it is necessary to make cement mortar that is waterproof or hydrophobic. The purpose of this study was to look at the effect of the composition of hydrophobic agents on the large contact angle and strength of mortal cement. The hydrophobic agent used is Tetrahydrofuran (THF) with polyurethane (PU) with variations of 5:6molar, 1:10molar, 1:10.9 molar with total each variation being 11 molars. The control variables in this study are the amount of composition of otawa sand, aquades and silica sand 20-30 mesh which is 4:11:2 mold 5 cm x 5cm cement mortar cubes, long immersion with Ca(OH)2 10% for 7 days, temperature 60 \u00b0C and heating length 1 hour. The large angle of contact is measured using the caessyal drop method and the hardness value using the hardness vickers tool. The results showed that the higher the concentration of Polyuteran, the smaller the contact angle of mortar cement produced. The largest contact angle occurs at the concentration of THF variation: PU 6:5 mol. The optimum contact angle is 126\u00b0 and the mortal seemen are hydrophobic. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Epidemiology suggests that small strokes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can cause cognitive impairment, leading to vascular dementia. The prefrontal cortex is a structure in the brain that is located in the frontal lobe. Accurate detection or diagnosis becomes important for therapeutic management because, it is difficult to identify at an early stage. Therefore, in this study, an analysis of differences in brain activation in healthy elderly (non-stroke) and post-stroke patients with vascular dementia was conducted when performing memory recall work. This study involved seven elderly non-stroke and seven stroke patients with vascular dementia. Brain activity was recorded using a 19-channel clinical electroencephalogram (EEG). The study compared prefrontal cortex activity during an attention test. Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was used to analyze active brain areas. Then the analysis of differences in prefrontal cortex activity between non-stroke patients and those with vascular dementia used a paired T-test. The results of the paired T-test (with p<0.05) showed that elderly non-strokes produced significant differences in activity when repeating numbers correctly (remember the numbers) and incorrectly (forget the numbers), while in stroke patients with vascular dementia, there was no significant difference when repeating numbers correctly and incorrectly. Another implication is that there is a decrease in the prefrontal cortex activity in stroke patients with dementia compared to elderly non-stroke patients.

      "Currently, the concept of video surveillance at home can already be supported by a CCTV system or IP camera installed at home connected to an internet connection. However, the CCTV or IP Camera device is only equipped with minimal features, generally only a motion detection feature that will provide notifications or alerts if motion or motion objects are detected in the observed area. It causes inconvenience to the user because too many alerts appear if the area being observed is often accompanied by the movement of people or objects, which is a natural thing and does not need to be suspected. The application of artificial intelligence systems in the home area is expected to increase the capability of home video surveillance to be smarter in giving notifications/alerts. In this research, smart video surveillance is developed using two schemes of video stream processing: full local processing and semi-cloud processing.

      "Currently, the concept of video surveillance at home can already be supported by a CCTV system or IP camera installed at home connected to an internet connection. However, the CCTV or IP Camera device is only equipped with minimal features, generally only a motion detection feature that will provide notifications or alerts if motion or motion objects are detected in the observed area. It causes inconvenience to the user because too many alerts appear if the area being observed is often accompanied by the movement of people or objects, which is a natural thing and does not need to be suspected. The application of artificial intelligence systems in the home area is expected to increase the capability of home video surveillance to be smarter in giving notifications/alerts. In this research, smart video surveillance is developed using two schemes of video stream processing: full local processing and semi-cloud processing. Two edge computing devices connected locally to the internet are installed in the home area. Both devices consist of Jetson Nano and PC GPU (Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ, 8GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060).

      "As information spreads on the internet, users need more personalized information. A recommender system can be applied to achieve this. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a method that can be applied to a recommender system to find hidden features in the relationship matrix between items and between users. However, the recommender system faces several problems, one of which is data sparsity. The SVD algorithm itself considers an empty rating value as 0. In solving this problem, the SVD algorithm can be combined with rating predictions using the Slope One algorithm. The Slope One algorithm is applied to complete the empty rating data so that the model can be trained with more complete data. So, the Slope-SVD method can improve the accuracy of the recommender system. This study aims to apply the Slope-SVD algorithm to a book recommender system using a rating dataset from the Goodreads web. The performance of the system was tested with the Mean Square Error (MAE). The test results from this study indicate that combining the Slope One algorithm with SVD gives better results than each Slope One or SVD alone.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "In this study, we propose the effect of Electroencephalography (EEG) stroke signal processing into energy distribution images using energy distribution for stroke conditions. The EEG signals are used as an alternative method to help the improvement of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to detect stroke conditions. The energy distribution clarifies the relationship for each channel while converting the EEG signal into an energy distribution image. The Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and ANN-BP are used as a method for image feature values to get the optimal system feature after brain mapping using Power Spectrum Density (PSD). We evaluate the system performances via a series of computer simulations. We investigate the feature combination using GLCM by taking the best 11 features, i.e., contrast, correlation, variance, entropy, homogeneity, energy, sum variance, sum entropy, difference variance, difference entropy and inverse difference momentum with an accuracy equal to 61.25%. Thus, the GA uses to select the feature on GLCM in order to find the best combination for the BCI system in this study. We found the accuracy value of GA-GLCM equals 72.5% with features, i.e., contrast, correlation, homogeneity, energy, sum variance, and different variance, while the EEG signal is tested with accuracy equals 59%. The result shows that the BCI system can be optimized using the converted EEG signal into energy distribution images.

      "In the era of big data and cloud computing, digital records of supermarket sales data and other accompanying factors are ubiquitous. However, less than optimal WeeklySale s can occur due to several factors influencing it. This study proposes particle swarm optimization with gradient boosting regression (PSO-GBR) as a solution for optimizing the association rule in supermarket sales based on a regression model that can predict WeeklySales. As a benchmark for this research, we compare our proposed GBR with two legacy prediction methods: linear regression (LR) and AdaBoost Regression (ABR). The first step is data preparation. Then we develop a model that can predict sales from the dataset using GBR. The next step is to evaluate the model with benchmark methods. Then with an optimum regression method, we optimize sales using PSO. The last step is to show that the method provides optimum WeeklySale s results. The results show that our proposed GBR has a higher R2 score than LR and ABR, namely 0.95 and 0.94 for train data and test data, respectively. Then PSO is proven to optimize sales using the GBR model as a cost function. PSO can increase the ten lowest WeeklySales of the actual dataset from a total of US 45 to a total of US 2, 296.9 by selecting a more optimized Department according to the GBR prediction. This research proves that we can use a regression model with good performance for a cost function in PSO optimization for department sales.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

Finally, the sentiment analysis of the discourse on the removal of the UN is expected to provide a general picture to the government regarding public opinion from the point of view of data coming from social media. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

      "Testing is an important process of software development. Testing the software can perform as expected by the application user and not do something the user does not expect. Over time, the need for mobile phones is increasing. In early 2020, the Indonesian government required Indonesian citizens to download the PeduliLindungi application on their respective mobile phones. In this research, MBT (Model-Based Testing) with the Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) approach is proposed as a research method because EFSM can perform testing on applications that have CRUD systems. CRUD is where the system can do data management. As a result, it is found that EFSM can be tested with a CRUD system, and testing will be faster if using a weighted random algorithm strategy. However, several stages must be done manually from the time of the testing process because of some elements of the application change under certain conditions. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Accurate prediction of heavy rainfall events is crucial to mitigate hydrometeorological disasters. The real-time cloud observation by weather satellites Himawari-8 has enabled researchers to develop a nowcasting method (short-term prediction) to identify rainfall events in advance, namely the Rapidly Developing Cumulus Area (RDCA) method. The RDCA index, which is the product of the RDCA method, is the probability of occurrence of heavy rainfall. It has been evaluated and successfully utilized in Japan. However, the performance of the RDCA in the tropics has not been assessed yet. Indonesia \u2014as a tropical country consisting of abundant islands\u2014 exhibits distinct climate and convective systems due to its geographical characteristics. Different temporal resolution of Himawari-8 data between Japan region (2.5 min) and the tropics (10 min) may also result in different RDCA performance. Therefore, it is important to conduct an evaluation study before operating the RDCA in Indonesia. By performing spatial comparison and using dichotomous and probabilistic verifications with rain gauges at various thresholds, this study finds that the RDCA is able to detect and predict rainfall events in Indonesia. The best lead time is 10 min but the predictive signals extend up to 30 min in advance; it is shorter than that observed in Japan. Lighter rainfall has higher predictability compared with heavier rainfall. The predicted heavy rainfall events show good accuracy, probability of detection, and brier score. The RDCA index and rainfall intensity appear to have a good correlation, where light (heavy) rainfall is better predicted by low (high) RDCA indices. It confirms the usefulness of varying RDCA index in contrast to the classic dichotomous RDCA index. This study reveals the positive prospects of RDCA in Indonesia. We also discuss some future challenges and give possible recommendations regarding an operational RDCA system. This study will benefit the development of early warning systems in Indonesia. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.",

      "For many nations, including Indonesia, tourism is crucial. Following the oil and gas sector, tourism is Indonesia's second-largest source of foreign currency earnings. A comfortable operation of tourism activities depends on the presence of amenities like hotels and tourist attractions. To ensure that tourism operates smoothly, it is also crucial to understand the meaning behind customer feedback to maintain good facilities and services and improve inadequate or poor facilities. The data used in this work is based on reviews of 150 hotels in the 'Best Value Hotels' category in Indonesia from the Tripadvisor website. The reviews contained in the data are reviews in the form of positive and negative. The data is then processed for machine learning model training to classify sentiments as positive or negative reviews. We then applied feature extraction methods such as Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) sampling method and compared the three models' performance with and without using them. This work also implements the trained model into web-based application, so the user can perform sentiment analysis on hotel reviews independently. The result is the overall performance of the three models in performing sentiment analysis on hotel reviews are great.

      "Cancer is still a problem in Indonesia for both the country and its sufferer. A way to reduce the impact of this problem is to detect the presence of cancer early on. For detecting the presence of cancer in the bones, we must perform a whole-body bone scan and segment it afterward. In many studies about whole-body bone scan images segmentation, the data usually comes from one source. Therefore, data scarcity problems may occur. The idea of using different sources may have an impact since there are size differences in bone geometry between different ethnicities. In this study, a system that can segment whole-body bone scan images automatically is proposed. The system is designed by using the Btrfly-Net method. Furthermore, the impact of using cross-domain dataset and augmentation methods is observed. The result shows that the system can segment bone scan with 0.856 and 0.780 dice coefficient score using the Btrfly-Net and U-Net methods, respectively. Moreover, augmentation method could increase the Btrfly-Net system metric over 1% while decreasing U-Net system metric over 2-6%. The decreasing metric occurrence in the U-Net system is not caused by the augmentation method directly. Furthermore, there are metric differences in using cross-domain dataset over 3-6%. However, further analysis shows that the cross-domain themselves do not cause the differences.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Along with revenue, one of the necessary metrics in calculating gross profit for profitability analysis is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). The objective of measuring profitability with gross profit is to reckon how efficient an enterprise manages the labors and supplies in carrying out the production process or services provision. In allocating COGS for product profitability analysis, Activity-Based Costing (ABC) is a costing technique that allows cost allocation based on the activities carried out in the production process. Companies from various industries have adopted ABC with available supporting tools like ERP system. This paper will discuss a case study of a telecommunications company in Indonesia that implements SAP S/4HANA for the cost allocation with ABC and profitability analysis processes. The company still faces shortcomings in its daily business operation, particularly profitability analysis reporting. The current COGS report for profitability analysis in the implemented system does not provide information about the source of the cost allocation, thus causing it hard to trace and further analyze the cost of activities contributing to the production of a product. Report customization can be a solution to accommodate the information needed. This research explains the designing of report customization with ABAP List Viewer (ALV) by applying iterative incremental model approach. Customization of the report reduces the steps needed to trace and analyze business process sources from the allocated COGS of a product to only one single step. The results presented in this paper may provide a solution for tracing cost allocation sources to analyze and determine the proper course of action regarding profitability and cost management.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "This paper presents a reconfigurable phase difference of hybrid coupler design. The proposed design is developed based on a branch-line coupler structure where a pair of conventional lines directly connecting the input and output ports are replaced by variable electrical length lines. To realize variable-length lines, a loaded-line structure composed of three microstrip line segments with four loading capacitors is adopted. A circuit prototype working at 2.4 GHz frequency is realized and measured for verification. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed coupler can exhibit a reconfigurable phase difference characteristic. By varying capacitances of 0.5 pF to 2.5 pF, a phase difference range of 45\u00b0 from -67.5\u00b0 to -112.5\u00b0 can be achieved. The prototype has the size of 18.2 mm by 41.2 mm, which is smaller than the conventional one.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

This study focuses on the service quality analysis of DANA, one of Indonesia's most extensive digital wallet applications and the top-ranking finance application on the Google Play Store. This study aims to determine the essential future improvements of digital wallet applications based on user reviews using multiclass classification and sentiment analysis.

The result achieves an accuracy of 0.784 with a dataset of 11,885 user reviews. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis against the seven dimensions identifies more than 69% positive sentiments in all dimensions, except the compensation dimension approaching less than 42%, implying that the dominating digital wallet issue resides in the customer's compensation problem.

      "Digital image has played an essential role in computer vision. However, it often suffers from blurriness. Thus, computer vision systems require an automated blur detection process to exclude blurred images. Furthermore, blur detection could prevent misinterpretation by a subsequent operation, such as image classification. This study explores some existing blur detection methods, including focus measure thresholding, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) on globally blurred images. Those methods are robust for abroad applications such as blur detection, region segmentation, multi-class blur classification, autofocus, and shape-from-focus (SFF). Nevertheless, those methods theoretically could also be used for blur detection on globally blur images. We evaluate the techniques on a public and private dataset.

      "Digital image has played an essential role in computer vision. However, it often suffers from blurriness. Thus, computer vision systems require an automated blur detection process to exclude blurred images. Furthermore, blur detection could prevent misinterpretation by a subsequent operation, such as image classification. This study explores some existing blur detection methods, including focus measure thresholding, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) on globally blurred images. Those methods are robust for abroad applications such as blur detection, region segmentation, multi-class blur classification, autofocus, and shape-from-focus (SFF). Nevertheless, those methods theoretically could also be used for blur detection on globally blur images. We evaluate the techniques on a public and private dataset. The result indicates that the proposed CNN model performs the best blur detection among other methods. This model achieves 0.900 in accuracy, 0.857 in specificity, 0.942 in sensitivity, 0.868 in precision, 0.937 in negative predictive value (NPV), 0.904 in f1-score, and has an average execution time of 0.233 seconds.

      "Orientation: Effective human resource practices (HRP) that include recruitment, orientation, training, career development, compensation and industrial relations that suit the needs of employees can improve the psychological aspects of organisational support and employee engagement (EE) that have an impact on minimising employees\u2019 turnover intention (TI). Research purpose: To analyse the effect of human resources practices, perceived organisational support and EE in minimising employees\u2019 TI in a state-owned transportation company. Motivation for the study: This study provides an in-depth analysis of factors affecting employees\u2019 intention to leave and recommends solutions to develop a conductive, productive working atmosphere. Identifying the employee\u2019s intention to leave is important in controlling turnover. Research approach/design and method: The study was conducted based on the social exchange theory. The researcher used a nonprobability, convenience sampling method and distributed 450 questionnaires to respondents with the help of the HR department. About 377 questionnaires were returned and met the criteria for data processing. The study uses a quantitative approach; data processing uses SEM procedures. Main findings: This research found that effective HRP in accordance with the needs of employees have a direct and significant influence on the increased perceived organisational support and EE. However, HRP was found not to affect TI. Further analysis shows that perceived organisational support and EE simultaneously act as mediating variables that link HRP and TI. Practical/managerial implications: The positive behaviour of employees can be developed through the company\u2019s effort of establishing a conducive, supportive work environment for employees. Contribution/value-add: Studies related to work behaviour in State-owned Enterprise (SOEs) are important so that human resource leaders or managers and other policymakers have a broader point of view when putting together HR programmes, considering that they have a big impact on employees and enterprises. However, cross-sectional data collection makes the generalisation rate of the findings should be carefully observed. \u00a9 2022. The Authors.",

      "This work proposes a new flow-shop scheduling model that consists of several flow-shops. Every flowshop acts as an independent entity, but there is a collaboration among them. Although the relation between flow-shopsand their customers is exclusive, collaboration through production sharing is possible. This circumstance is differentfrom most studies in flow-shop scheduling problems (FSP), for example, parallel or distributed, where all jobs comefrom a single point and are then distributed to the production resources. In the multiple independent flow-shops, eachflow-shop has its own processing time and production cost. Through collaboration, efficiency can be achieved in themake-span and total cost aspects, which becomes the objective of this work. This model is developed by combiningthe first price sealed bid auction and cloud theory-based simulated annealing. The first price sealed bid auction isconducted to minimize the total production cost. Meanwhile, the cloud theory-based simulated annealing is conductedto minimize the make-span. This model is then compared with the existing non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm(NSGA II) based flow-shop scheduling models. The first existing model is a parallel flow-shop, while the second oneis a collaborative flow-shop.

      "Fraud on health insurance impacts cost overruns and a quality decline in health services in the long term. The use of machine learning to detect fraud on health insurance is increasingly popular. However, one challenge in predicting health insurance fraud is the data imbalance. The data imbalance can cause a bias towards the majority class in many machine learning methods. Oversampling is a solution for data imbalance by augmenting new data based on the existing minority class data. Recently, there has been growing interest in employing deep learning for data augmentation. One of them is using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). This paper proposes using GAN as an oversampling method to generate additional data for minority classes. Since data for detecting health insurance fraud are tabular, we adopt Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN) architecture where the generator is conditioned to adjust the tabular data input and receive additional information to produce samples according to the specified class conditions. The new balanced data are used to train 17 classification algorithms. Our experiments showed that the proposed method performs better than other oversampling methods on several evaluation metrics, i.e., accuracy, precision score, F1-score, and ROC. \u00a9 2022 University of Kuwait.

      "Imbalanced data typically refers to a condition in which several data samples in a certain problem is not equally distributed, thereby leading to the underrepresentation of one or more classes in the dataset. These underrepresented classes are referred to as a minority, while the overrepresented ones are called the majority. The unequal distribution of data leads to the machine's inability to carry out predictive accuracy in determining the minority classes, thereby causing various costs of classification errors. Currently, the standard framework used to solve the unequal distribution of imbalanced data learning is the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). However, SMOTE can produce synthetic minority data samples considered as noise, which is also part of the majority classes. Therefore, this study aims to improve SMOTE to identify the noise from synthetic minority data produced in handling imbalanced data by adding the Local Outlier Factor (LOF). The proposed method is called SMOTE-LOF, and the experiment was carried out using imbalanced datasets with the results compared with the performance of the SMOTE. The results showed that SMOTE-LOF produces better accuracy and f-measure than the SMOTE. In a dataset with a large number of data examples and a smaller imbalance ratio, the SMOTE-LOF approach also produced a better AUC than the SMOTE. However, for a dataset with a smaller number of data samples, the SMOTE's AUC result is arguably better at handling imbalanced data. Therefore, future research needs to be carried out using different datasets with combinations varying from the number of data samples and the imbalanced ratio. \u00a9 2021 The Authors",

The neutral electrolyte of Na2SO4 (sodium sulphate) was used to obtain higher cell voltages of supercapacitor. To investigate the performance of the flexible supercapacitor, we varied the concentration of CA (0-30%). The supercapacitor consisted of the hydrogel and two activated carbons which were assembled in between. The resulted supercapacitors were then characterized using FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) to evaluate the chemical bond formation in the hydrogel electrolyte. Electrochemical characteristic of the supercapacitors was also analyzed by EIS and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The results showed that the addition of 15% and 30 % CA yielded the crosslinking reaction of PVA/HEC as represented by reduction of O-H groups and the existence of C=O groups. The hydrogel of 15% CA produced the lowest ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) of 45 \u03c9 and the highest specific capacitance of 43.05 F/g.

Accordingly, this paper proposes a dynamic aspect-based rating system accompanied by an aspect-based rating visualization to address the aforementioned problems.

      "Gold, apart from being used as jewelry, is also an important commodity used for investment by investors. Gold is used as an investment because of the nature of gold that can maintain its value from inflation. Furthermore, gold price prediction is essential because it can reduce investment risk, thus assisting in determining investment policy. Gold price data has high fluctuation characteristics. Therefore, the Conv-LSTM algorithm has been used to predict gold prices within daily and weekly time frames. Conv-LSTM will be tested using four parameters with a testing ratio of 20% and 40%. Performance measurement generated by the model is carried out using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results obtained for daily data with a ratio of 20% are 9.658063 MAE and 14,83934 RMSE, and for a 40% ratio are 8.680931 MAE and 12,92464 RMSE. The results obtained for weekly data with a ratio of 20% are 21.86957 MAE and 31.49406 RMSE, and for a ratio of 40% are 21.05697 MAE and 28.2758 RMSE. The results show that Conv-LSTM can study trends in the data to predict gold prices. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

The manipulator has three servo motors which can measure the angular position and the angular velocity. The forward kinematics defines the desired angular velocity of each servo motor that will be used as a feed-forward value of the PID controller. The inverse kinematic provides the desired angle of each motor to reach the desired position. Correspondingly, the desired angular velocity and the desired angle are used as the input of the PID controller to control the angular velocity. Here, the PID controller is tuned using the Ziegler-Nichols Tuning 1st method. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct three cases experiment: (1). 2D rectangular shape with four constant reference points, (2). 2D circular shape with time-varying reference points, (3). 3D rectangular shapes with time-varying reference points.

The nutritional content of meat consists of fat, calories, trans fat, saturated fat, calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and magnesium. Due to its good nutritional content, the demand for meat in Indonesia has increased. However, there are problems with meat health. Meat is prone to spoilage and is quickly contaminated with microbes. The microbial population can spoil or spoil the meat. Checking the feasibility of meat is usually done by looking at the texture of the meat traditionally. However, this method is less effective in assessing the feasibility of meat. Therefore, another method is used to determine the feasibility of meat, namely using the Electronic Nose (e-nose) with the Neural Network (NN) algorithm. Because by using an e-nose, that can find out the smell or smell of decent meat. They are applying the NN algorithm for classification to work in a structured manner on each component needed to determine meat quality. These results can help people to get the meat of good quality.

      "Conflict situations in football have become a significant issue because they affect the players, supporters, referees, management team, the governing body of football, and the government. As time passes, the discovery of conflicts within the football industry has also become increasingly diverse; both affected in-game or out of the game. In 2015, Indonesia had no activity in football for almost a year when the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) banned the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) from competing in international competitions until the conflict among their internal agents was resolved. The agents involved in this highly controversial ban include the Commission 10 of the Parliament of Indonesia, the National Sports Committee of Indonesia (KONI), the Indonesian President, and the Ministry of Youth and Sport of Indonesia. Conflict resolution strategies outside the football games are delicate and more challenging to overcome due to the involvement of the government and various governing bodies. This opens to higher unpredictability in modeling the conflict situations, hence a lower possibility of a successful conflict resolution model strategy. In addressing this gap, this paper proposes a new Computational Intelligence approach based on the Soft Set Theory, where an alternative algorithm is derived from modeling the conflict situations. We then delineated the proposed algorithm for an instructional example of the Indonesian football conflict situation in 2015 concerning the Indonesia Football Super League. The results showed that the proposed algorithm successfully handled conflict and recommended the Indonesian football agents involved, including PSSI and FIFA. \u00a9 2022.

In addition, the system for determining the orientation of the robot direction using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method has a high error rate of 33% because it is often confused between the front and back of the robot.

We consider two system models for quantum communications based on OAM, i.e., (i) a general structure of a simple OAM-based quantum communication system and (ii) a simple quantum error correction coding scheme for 3-dimensional system or quantum ternary digit (qutrit). We theoretically evaluate the possible construction of OAM-based quantum communications supported by qutrit-based error corrections. We found that OAM-based quantum communications are possibly supported by the derived controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and stabilizers for qutrit bit flip error corrections. The qutrit stabilizers have shown that they can completely correct all qutrit single bit-flip errors.

      "This paper discusses an autonomous robot navigation system for the gas source localization problem in an unknown and GPS-denied environment to find a single gas source transported in turbulent wind flow using mobile robot olfaction (MRO). A new autonomous navigation system method is proposed by combining simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), gas distribution mapping (GDM), and anemotaxis. We developed two destination evaluation algorithms for the navigation system, frontier-multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and Anemotaxis-GDM, to drive the robot towards a gas source. The frontier-MCDM uses to select destination candidates for gas contaminant discovery. The Anemotaxis-GDM is used for gas source tracking when the robot's gas sensor detects gas contamination. The GSL process ends after the declaration of the gas source. The simulation results for three different environments with one gas source validate the effectiveness of the frontier-MCDM and anemotaxis-GDM algorithms. The simulation results show that the frontier-MCDM algorithm has a 60% success rate in finding gas contamination compared to the FFD-IG_CL strategy (13.3%) and frontier-IG_CL strategy (20%). The evaluation of anemotaxis-GDM algorithm simulation results based on the average accuracy index indicates that the robot's final pose is close to the gas source. The average simulation success ratio is 71.1%. \u00a9 2022, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.",

We developed two destination evaluation algorithms for the navigation system, frontier-multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and Anemotaxis-GDM, to drive the robot towards a gas source. The frontier-MCDM uses to select destination candidates for gas contaminant discovery. The Anemotaxis-GDM is used for gas source tracking when the robot's gas sensor detects gas contamination. The GSL process ends after the declaration of the gas source. The simulation results for three different environments with one gas source validate the effectiveness of the frontier-MCDM and anemotaxis-GDM algorithms. The simulation results show that the frontier-MCDM algorithm has a 60% success rate in finding gas contamination compared to the FFD-IG_CL strategy (13.3%) and frontier-IG_CL strategy (20%). The evaluation of anemotaxis-GDM algorithm simulation results based on the average accuracy index indicates that the robot's final pose is close to the gas source. The average simulation success ratio is 71.1%. \u00a9 2022, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved."

      "Sleep analysis is often used to identify sleep-related human health. In many cases, sleep disorders could cause a particular disease. One of the approaches to detect sleep disorders is by investigating human sleep stages. However, the selection of the proper electrocardiogram (ECG) features is still considered challenging and becomes an issue to achieve the performance of the algorithm used. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate which ECG features are very significant to the performance of the algorithm. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) method has been utilized to classify sleep stages into two classes namely awake and sleep. In order to improve the classification performances, an optimization method of grid search was used to find the best parameters of the SVM. Feature selection of information gain was then used to find the most significant ECG features. To validate the performance results, one leave-subject out cross-validation has been conducted during the implementation. There were ten subjects involved in this implementation. The ECG signals from those ten subjects were used to differentiate awake from sleep state. Based on the results, our method obtained an average accuracy of 85.46% a precision of 84.05% and a recall of 85.44% respectively. \u00a9 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

      "Glaucoma is an eye disease that can cause irreversible blindness to people if not treated properly. Although deep learning models have shown that they can provide good results in identifying diseases from medical imagery, they suffer from the vulnerability of adversarial attacks, making them perform poorly. Several techniques can be applied to improve defense against such attacks. One of which is adversarial training (AT) which trains a deep learning model using the input's gradient used to generate noises to the input image and Deep k-Nearest Neighbor (DkNN) that enforces prediction's conformity based on nearest neighbor voting on each layer's representation. This work tries to improve the defense against adversarial attacks by combining AT and DkNN. The evaluation performed on several adversarial attacks show that given an optimum k, the combination of these two methods is able to improve most models' overall classification result on the perturbed retinal fundus image. \u00a9 2022",

In such system, the availability of channel state information (CSI) is critical issue that will determine overall performance of the system.

By taking advantage of the channel sparseness, compressive sensing (CS) can be utilized for channel estimation with much fewer pilot symbols. In this paper, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is employed to reconstruct channel impulse response. We evaluate the performance in terms of NMSE and BER.

How to create communication with humans is one of the most essential components of social robots. Nonverbal communication, such as reading body language and recognizing facial expressions, is one approach for robots to communicate.

Specifically, to improve the model's performance speed, we simplify CSPDarknet53 and path aggregation network (PANet) for the feature extraction stage of YOLOv4 by reducing the convolution layers. Moreover, we introduce the simplification technique to reduce the number of channels in CSPDarknet53 by multiplying it with the scaling coefficient. In addition, we add spatial attention module (SAM) to the structures, which can improve whole system performance on two types of lumber datasets (pine and rubber lumber).

To obtain insights into how the angular and spectral bandwidth of meta-atoms relate to the metasurface focusing performance, point dipole models are used which incorporate different aspects of the meta-atoms' angular response. It is emphasized that despite the meta-atoms being designed under the assumption that they support a single dipolar resonance, other resonances exist within the meta-atom geometry and become stronger at oblique incidence. These resonances disturb the designed phase and amplitude responses, resulting in lower focusing efficiency at higher incident angles. The modeling of higher order modes leads to good agreement with the experimental measurements, confirming that angular dispersion of the meta-atoms is the dominant mechanism in determining off-axis aberrations.  \u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.",

      "Conformance checking detects deviations in business process executions. An online detection method is needed to give immediate response to anticipate possible impacts. The state-of-the-art online conformance checking is the Prefix-Alignment (PA) technique. However, this technique has a limitation of maintaining all of the administration data of cases in memory. In an online environment, the last event of a case is never known, whereas a PA requires last event information to release the case from memory to free up space for other cases. Hence, the PA does not meet the requirements of online conformance checking in processing infinite data of event stream without memory constraints. PA also has a complex state space search computation especially for large and complex process model references. In this paper, a Graph-Based Online Token Replay (GO-TR) method is proposed. This method takes benefit from Graph Database to adapts the Token-Based Replay (TBR) technique which has simple replay computation. We propose a Replay Image (RI) to store the case administration and develop a cypher based algorithm to simulate token replay on the RI to handle the event stream. We also propose a cypher-based algorithm to identify and replay invisible paths. The experiment results show that GO-TR has been successful in adapting TBR and solving the problem of wrong-placed tokens in TBR. GO-TR outperforms PA in yielding replay throughputs of relatively small amount of data in online conformance checking. In terms of memory usage, GO-TR shows its superiority over PA because it does not have memory limitations problems. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

One of the issues arising from these applications is how objects can be placed in physical environments using an AR system. Object placement consists of two processes: object detection and segmentation. Due to the importance of placement, in this paper, we propose using deep learning to address issues with the placement of objects through detection and segmentation in AR. Deep learning can help complete tasks by providing correct information about environmental changes in real-time situations. The problem is that it is rarely used in AR, which suggests a combination of deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation with wearable AR technology to improve performance on complex tasks. In our work, we propose to address this problem by applying a convolutional neural network to facilitate the detection and segmentation of objects in real environments. To measure AR performance, we examined detection accuracy in environments with different intensities.

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were added to improve mechanically and release properties. CNC was isolated from pineapple leaf fibers through the ammonium persulfate method resulting in a mixture of rod-like whisker and spherical morphology. The mechanical properties of hydrogels are increasing with the addition of CNC. Hydrogels containing 8% CNC exhibited 7.266 N/mm2tensile strength, 156.3% maximum strain, and 700.3 N/mm2elastic modulus. Drug release tests containing sodium diclofenac were done by taking incubated phosphate buffer saline samples in a pH 7.4 environment and showed that all CNC variations tested are controllable for the first 30 min compared to the sample without CNC. Sodium diclofenac is easily eluted from hydrogel due to its polar properties, and all samples almost demonstrated the same release profile. PVA hydrogels showed fluctuating concentrations of diclofenac compared to others. While hydrogels containing rutin showed a controlled release mode, the addition of CNC in PVA resulted in a slower release of rutin, possibly due to the better binding between CNC and rutin.

Speech denoising has many benefits for instance in voice communication or voice recognition where fast denoising process are needed. This paper evaluates the use of Wiener Filter for noise reduction. Enhancement of distorted speech by additive noise with only single observation has been done and still a challenging problem. We add the noise to the sample clean speech to obtain noisy speech. We generate noise level for SNR 0 up to 0.5dB with increment 0.01dB. We choose low SNR to represent high additive noise. We further apply Wiener Noise Reduction to the noisy speech to obtain filtered noisy speech. Finally, we compare the Mean Square Error (MSE) of filtered speech and the original speech for every noise level. The results show that the noise has been decreased. The non-speech parts now appear better since the noisy part have been suppressed.

Authentication mechanisms can be used to ward off attacks. However, the implementation of authentication mechanisms on IoT devices is challenging.

Two-factor authentication using RFID and fingerprint can be a solution in providing an authentication mechanism.

The operation of power plants using fossil fuels impacts emissions harmful to the environment. This paper discusses a new technique for determining the cost of reducing emissions through optimizing generators operations by considering emissions, which is often named Economic Emission Dispatch. The optimization method used is a candidate area reduction technique. This technique was tested using 500 kV, 25 buses with various loads, and the Java-Bali electrical system. The ratio between the cost and emission difference is determined in various conditions from the combination of costs and emissions weights. The results are compared with several other methods such as the Firefly algorithm, Cuckoo algorithm, and particle swarm optimization. These various methods show that the emission reduction costs are USD41.8 to USD54.5 per ton of emission. This paper provides input to the government in making policies related to flexible power plant emission control.

      "Orchid plants are one of the ornamental plants that are much favored by humans because they have an attraction that is very beautiful flower parts. This causes many people to try to make the cultivation of orchids themselves. But behind the beauty of orchid plants, very good care is needed because orchids need the right moisture content and humidity in the room in order to grow well. The humidity that orchids need is 50% - 80% during the day. By using the help of the ESP8266 module and the DHT-11 Temperature Sensor, it can help to monitor orchid humidity and predict the humidity obtained in the next time. Also added a relay, and Mist Maker to help increase humidity. If the results of the prediction are less than 50%, the relay will automatically flow electric current to the mist maker and can help raise the humidity back to 50%. Predictions are obtained from the results of experimental humidity measurements carried out for 24 hours. The results of the predictions obtained are quite accurate because the difference with the humidity presentation differs by about 0.2 from the humidity measurement results obtained.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

In this study, the development of an e-learning website interface was carried out using a component-based architecture. The application of component-based architecture aims to make program code on a component reusable, flexible, and simplify the maintenance process. This research will use the Vue.js framework to implement component-based architectures. The results of the website interface program code using Vue.js will be tested using automated testing with a unit test using Jest. Automated testing can provide fast feedback and allow developers to find code errors after they have been created. Testing with unit testing using Jest will produce a code coverage matrix that is used to state parts of the software code that are not tested. The matrix indicates that there are sufficient tests of program code, resulting in a rarity of software bugs and providing confidence for developers to modify existing code.

      "Air pollution transport is entangled with weather and climate factors. As the pollutants tend to move due to the metrological condition. Naturally, pollutants will be deposited to the ground at the end part of the deposition cycle. One of the factors of pollutant deposition in a wet deposition is rain. The soluble pollutants and particulate matter are precipitated to the earth's surface during precipitation. In order to analyse it, we need a rainfall measuring device/rain gauge, as rainfall is an important parameter to find the correlation between the two. However, there is a limited number of rain-gauge in Indonesia. Thus, we proposed a tipping bucket rain gauge, which consists of a funnel, a bucket, a magnetic switch sensor, and a microcontroller-based processing unit. The prototype is equipped with a GSM module so that the data can be sent in real-time via text message every minute, also an SD Card as the backup storage data. It was calibrated using ISO 17025:2005 standard, the result obtained by a resolution of 0.2 mm/tip with a capacity of 4.2 ml buckets, and U95 uncertainty of \u00b10,04 - \u00b10,12 mm/minute. To find the suitable method of rainfall calculation for the prototype, we observe three methods, Natural, Meteorology, and Novel-IAP. From the three we found, Novel-IAP has the best result since the calculation is executed every second.

      "As information spreads on the internet, users need more personalized information. A recommender system can be applied to achieve this. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a method that can be applied to a recommender system to find hidden features in the relationship matrix between items and between users. However, the recommender system faces several problems, one of which is data sparsity. The SVD algorithm itself considers an empty rating value as 0. In solving this problem, the SVD algorithm can be combined with rating predictions using the Slope One algorithm. The Slope One algorithm is applied to complete the empty rating data so that the model can be trained with more complete data. So, the Slope-SVD method can improve the accuracy of the recommender system. This study aims to apply the Slope-SVD algorithm to a book recommender system using a rating dataset from the Goodreads web. The performance of the system was tested with the Mean Square Error (MAE). The test results from this study indicate that combining the Slope One algorithm with SVD gives better results than each Slope One or SVD alone.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

Therefore, this study was conducted to observe and analyze the distribution of pollutants in the vertical direction and broaden the measurement points using drones. A drone was chosen considering the available high building is limited, also to minimalize the spatial differences. The measuring parameters are PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations and meteorological conditions (temperature/T, relative humidity/RH, and pressure/P). Two different times are chosen that are at day time (August 31, 2019) and nighttime (September 30, 2019), at altitudes up to \u223c80m.

      "A pulse height analyzer (PHA) is used to measure the frequency distribution of the signal output height of an event detector. However, the typical PHA algorithm has limitations in measurement; it cannot distinguish multiplet due to coincidence and singlet pulse. Coincidences will pile up the signals that make the pulse height value higher than it should be. Therefore, this study has developed a simple algorithm to calculate pulse height distribution with coincidence correction (PHA-CC). The developed algorithm firstly identified the coincidence pulse by considering its pulse width. The result shows that the developed algorithm could successfully distinguish multiplet and singlet pulses. The significance of pulse height distribution measured by the PHA-CC compared to regular PHA was also discussed in this paper. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "Cedarwood is one of the most sought-after materials since it can be used to create a wide variety of household appliances. Other than its unique aroma, the product's quality is the most important selling attribute. Fiber patterns allow for a qualitative categorization of this wood. Traditionally, workers in the wood-processing business have relied solely on their eyesight to sort materials into several categories. As a result, there will be discrepancies in precision and efficiency, which will hurt the reputation of the regional wood sector. The answer to this issue is machine learning. In this study, we compare the performance of two different cedarwood quality classification systems where both systems use different machine learning methods namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Each system will be sent images captured with a Logitech Brio 4K equipped with a joystick and ultrasonic sensors, labeled as belonging to one of five cedar classes (A, B, C, D, or E). In the initial method to learn the wood's pattern and texture, the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) will be used to identify the material. Meanwhile, the classification method uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) which will be compared to find the best accuracy and time computation. The first system's experiment achieves 90 percent accuracy with a computation time of 1.40 seconds. For the second, we use a Convolutional Neural Network, a deep learning technique, to classify cedarwood (CNN). Extraction of features occurs in the convolution, activation, and pooling layers. Experimental results demonstrated a considerable enhancement, with an accuracy of 97% and a prediction speed of 0.56 seconds. \u00a9 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

      "One of the respiratory disorders is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA occurs when a person sleeps. OSA causes breathing to stop momentarily due to obstruction in the airways. In this condition, people with OSA will be deprived of oxygen, sleep awake and short of breath. Diagnosis of OSA by a doctor can be done by confirming the patient's complaints during sleep, sleep patterns, and other symptoms that point to OSA. Another way of diagnosing OSA is a polysomnography (PSG) examination in the laboratory to analyze apnea and hypopnea. However, this examination tends to be high cost and time consuming. An alternative diagnostic tool is an electrocardiogram (ECG) examination referring to changes in the mechanism of ECG-derived respiration (EDR). So digital ECG signal analysis is a potential tool for OSA detection. Therefore, in this study, it is proposed to classify OSA based on ECG signals using wavelets and statistical parameters. Statistical parameters include mean, variance, skewness kurtosis entropy calculated on the signal decomposition results. The validation performance of the proposed method is carried out using a support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and ensemble classifier. The proposed method produces the highest accuracy of 89.2% using a bagged tree where all features are used as predictors. From this study, it is hoped that ECG signal analysis can be used to complete clinical diagnosis in detecting OSA. \u00a9 2022 J.J.

      "Dengue fever is a viral mosquito-borne disease, a significant global health concern, with more than one third of the world population at risk of acquiring the disease. Caused by 4 antigenically distinct but related virus serotypes, named DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, infection by one serotype confers lifelong immunity to that serotype and a short period of temporary cross immunity to other related serotypes. Severe dengue is epidemiologically associated with a secondary infection caused by a heterologous serotype via the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), an immunological process enhancing a new infection. Within-host dengue modeling is restricted to a small number of studies so far. With many open questions, the understanding of immunopathogenesis of severe disease during recurrent infections is important to evaluate the impact of newly licensed vaccines. In this paper, we revisit the modeling framework proposed by Sebayang et al. and perform a detailed sensitivity analysis of the well-known biological parameters and its possible combinations to understand the existing data sets. Using numerical simulations, we investigate features of viral replication, antibody production, and infection clearance over time for three possible scenarios: primary infection, secondary infection caused by homologous serotype, and secondary infection caused by heterologous serotype. Besides, describing well the infection dynamics as reported in the immunology literature, our results provide information on parameter combinations to best describe the differences on the immunological dynamics of secondary infections with homologous and heterologous viruses. The results presented here will be used as baseline to investigate a more complex within-host dengue model. \u00a9 2022 Vizda Anam et al.",

      "This work proposes a new coordinated ambulance routing model suitable for implementation during the COVID19 pandemic. This model is different from the existing model, where it was conducted uncoordinatedly, so that mismatch between supply and demand may occur. In general, high number of unserved requests and travel distance are unwanted. Therefore, this work proposes a model consisting of three steps: hospital-patient allocation, ambulance-patient dispatching, and ambulance pickup-delivery sequencing. The proposed model consists of two objectives: minimizing the number of unserved patients and minimizing total travel distance. It is developed by using cloud-theory-based simulated annealing. The simulation result shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing uncoordinated model in number of unserved patients, total travel distance, and average travel distance. It creates zero unserved patients if the total number of patients does not surpass the total number of slots in all hospitals. It produces 12 to 19 percent lower total travel distance and 27 to 29 percent lower average travel distance than the uncoordinated model. \u00a9 2022, International Association of Engineers.

      "Purpose: The study aims to analyze the influence of hedonic, utilitarian, and self-esteem motivations on online shopping behavior. Likewise, the mediating role of impulsive shopping and shopping intentions is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: The study was carried out with the results of a survey in which 450 respondents participated, and the data was analyzed by using structural equation modeling (SmartPLS 3.0 software). Findings: All the hypothesized links were significant and positive except for the relationship of self-esteem motive with impulsive shopping tendency, which was negative as hypothesized. Moreover, hedonic motive had a strong positive impact on impulsive shopping tendency, whereas, in contrast, utilitarian motive had a strong positive impact on shopping intentions. Practical implications: Managers should focus on functional value rather than emotional value to attract customers who tend to be utilitarian. In contrast, for customers who tend to be hedonic, the product offerings should be visually appealing, stimulating and inspiring, as well as have emotional value. Originality/value: This study investigates the roles of self-esteem and hedonic motives in impulsive shopping behavior. Moreover, by using the theory of planned behavior, this study highlights the roles of hedonic and utilitarian motives in attitude toward engaging in online shopping. \u00a9 2022, Indrawati Indrawati, Gadang Ramantoko, Tri Widarmanti, Izzatdin Abdul Aziz and Farhat Ullah Khan.",

Even though there have been many reviews about restaurant products, there are still many reviews that are not convincing or biased, whether they are good or bad reviews. This problem is essential to be solved because biased judgments can affect the judgment of potential buyers and affect the business side of the restaurant. To solve this problem, a document-level sentiment analysis system was built with the input of a single review sentence and produces a positive or negative class output. The system was built using TF-IDF as a feature extraction method with the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification algorithm. The selection of the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification algorithm is because based on existing research, KNN results can be better than others because KNN performance is based on good features and the appropriate number of features.

This study conducted a design and simulation of a millimeter wave-based RoF system with a radio frequency of 64 GHz. A phase modulator is an external modulation technique to generate millimeter-wave signals. The considered parameters are the Bit Error Rate (BER), Q Factor, and Eye Diagram parameters for system analysis by varying optical cable lengths of 1 km, 3 km, and 5 km. By varying the length of the optical fiber, the system performance does not meet the recommended parameters for an optical fiber length of5 km, where the resulting minimum value of BER is greater than 10 {-9}.

Naturally, pollutants will be deposited to the ground at the end part of the deposition cycle. One of the factors of pollutant deposition in a wet deposition is rain. The soluble pollutants and particulate matter are precipitated to the earth's surface during precipitation. In order to analyse it, we need a rainfall measuring device/rain gauge, as rainfall is an important parameter to find the correlation between the two. However, there is a limited number of rain-gauge in Indonesia. Thus, we proposed a tipping bucket rain gauge, which consists of a funnel, a bucket, a magnetic switch sensor, and a microcontroller-based processing unit. The prototype is equipped with a GSM module so that the data can be sent in real-time via text message every minute, also an SD Card as the backup storage data.

To find the suitable method of rainfall calculation for the prototype, we observe three methods, Natural, Meteorology, and Novel-IAP.

The authors of this study will develop low portable telemedicine equipment for remote monitoring of parents' health (patients). Remote patient monitoring is one of the essential components of any telemedicine service. Patient data will be collected from remote locations using this tool. Seven parameters are collected in this tool, which are the patient's vital data, namely Electromyography (EMG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Accelerometer, and LUX sensor. EMG is used to determine muscle activity, EDA to measure moisture and skin activity levels, EKG to determine heart rate and monitor blood pressure, an accelerometer to observe body movements, and LUX sensor, which aims to determine pulse blood volume data. This device is portable and can be used easily with any telemedicine model. A mobile application has been developed to collect patient data from this device, control the device and send data to the server for the telemedicine application. The application interface is made simple so users can use it more easily.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

      "As information spreads on the internet, users need more personalized information. A recommender system can be applied to achieve this. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a method that can be applied to a recommender system to find hidden features in the relationship matrix between items and between users. However, the recommender system faces several problems, one of which is data sparsity. The SVD algorithm itself considers an empty rating value as 0. In solving this problem, the SVD algorithm can be combined with rating predictions using the Slope One algorithm. The Slope One algorithm is applied to complete the empty rating data so that the model can be trained with more complete data. So, the Slope-SVD method can improve the accuracy of the recommender system. This study aims to apply the Slope-SVD algorithm to a book recommender system using a rating dataset from the Goodreads web. The performance of the system was tested with the Mean Square Error (MAE). The test results from this study indicate that combining the Slope One algorithm with SVD gives better results than each Slope One or SVD alone.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Web services are provided with documents that at the very least specify the endpoint, input parameters, and output or response of each operation to expose their capabilities. This should be considered through an understandable format for humans and/or machines. In the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is used as a reference to create web service descriptions. However, it only supports syntactic interoperability, leading to the incapability of supporting the automated selection process. To overcome this, OAS documents must be enhanced by including semantics to each resource to provide \u201cunderstandable\u201d services. Therefore, this study aims to develop a system capable of transforming resources in OAS documents into RDF-based semantic web services. To begin, a relational database schema based on the OAS structure is created to store all objects in the OAS document. The published open-linked vocabulary was then used to create the ontology, which maps resources and their relationships on the RDF data model. To build RDF-based semantic web services, R2RML was used to generate the relational database model into triple RDF. The proposed system was also tested through prototyping and using a dataset of 106 OAS documents, which were downloaded from APIs.guru between 5\u201310 May 2021. The number of triple RDFs generated per document varied with resource rate. An OAS document generates 36 to 16,505 triple RDF in a dataset. The end product was a triple RDF knowledge base maintained by a graph management database. It is now possible to find service operations, input and output parameters, and service composition requirements utilizing the repository semantic web services using SPARQL. On the other hand, the use of relational databases to store OAS resources increased reuse efficiency by approximately 48%, owing to service developers designing interoperability between uniform parameter services, which were then used as input and output. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s).",

The distributed IoT ecosystem has many cybersecurity problems related to anomalous activities on the network. CIDS technology is usually applied to detect anomalous activities on the IoT network. CIDS is suitable for IoT network because they have the same distributed characteristic. The use of DLT technology is expected to be able to help the IDS system accelerate detection and increase the accuracy of detection through a collaborative detection mechanism. This review will look more deeply at the placement strategies, detection method, security threat, and validation & testing method from CIDS with DLT-based for IoT network.

      "This review presents the current state-of-the-art of the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) model used in the Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS) for anomaly detection in Internet of Things (IoT) network. The distributed IoT ecosystem has many cybersecurity problems related to anomalous activities on the network. CIDS technology is usually applied to detect anomalous activities on the IoT network. CIDS is suitable for IoT network because they have the same distributed characteristic. The use of DLT technology is expected to be able to help the IDS system accelerate detection and increase the accuracy of detection through a collaborative detection mechanism. This review will look more deeply at the placement strategies, detection method, security threat, and validation & testing method from CIDS with DLT-based for IoT network. This review also discusses the open issue and the lesson learned at the end of the review. The result is expected to produce the next research topic and help professionals design effective CIDS based on DLT for the IoT network. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

      "Nowadays, technology is growing rapidly followed by modernization. Face detection technology is one technology that has been developed and applied in various sectors such as biometrics recognition systems, retrieval systems, database indexing in digital video, security systems with restricted area access control, video conferencing, and human interaction systems. Eye detection is a further development of face detection in which the image of a human face was detected to be processed by detecting the location of both eyes on the face. Nowadays, the eye detection system can be used as a means of developing more complex applications and can be applied directly in the aspect of technology that uses eye detection like, eye state detection system, drowsiness and fatigue detection system, safety driving support systems or driver assistance system. In this study we propose drowsiness detection system utilizing current novel classification model such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), combined with Haar Cascade. The DNN is utilized to detect face, while Haar Cascade is utilized for detecting the eyes and its state on the detected face. In this study, due to Covid19 pandemic, we focused on developing the classifiers for detecting the face with mask. Apart from that, our proposed classifiers are also capable of identifying non-masked faces. The experimental result showed that by utilizing DNN and Haar Cascade, our proposed system could reach accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 measure as much as 81%, 88%, 80%, and 84%, respectively. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "In medical applications, the slightest distortion in the patient's medical image cannot be tolerated, as such distortion can lead to misdiagnoses and misleading conclusions. The robust reversible watermarking technique has received considerable attention, as it allows the complete extraction of the embedded watermark signal and the comprehensive reconstruction of the masking signal. This paper proposes a robust reversible watermarking (RRW) scheme based on Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and Multibit Spread Spectrum (MSS). The host image is broken down into several subbands using SWT. Then, the watermark is embedded into the subband diagonal detail coefficient of the host image using MSS. Finally, the watermarked subband is combined with other subbands using inverse SWT (ISWT) into a watermarked image. The embedded watermark is extracted on the receiving side, and the original medical image is precisely reconstructed without involving auxilary information. By the experimental results, the proposed robust reversible watermarking technique can restore the watermark and rebuild the host medical image perfectly without any attack. The watermarked images produced by the proposed reversible data hiding technique have better visual quality with a peak signal-to-noise ratio above 41 dB. In addition, the proposed RRW scheme is robust to various attacks such as compression, noise addition, sharpening, and image enhancement. \u00a9 2022. All Rights Reserved.",

A proper sales mechanism is needed to tackle this phenomenon. Lack of transparency on sales became a consideration for a creator who wanted to sell an asset in this medium. Most publishers do not honestly publish the number of sales to a creator because all the data is stored privately in the publisher server and can only be accessed by the publisher.

      "Fatigue has been considered as a major contributing factor to workplace accidents. While most previous studies on fatigue have been conducted in a laboratory setting, the current study was performed in the mining region of Kalimantan, Indonesia. This study assessed the fitness-for-work and fatigue experienced by 21 maintenance technicians at two mining workshops. This study focused on three independent variables: work shift (day shift and night shift), work locations (non-remote area and remote area), and individual fitness. Heart rate and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) data (in terms of total error and mean reaction time) were collected at the beginning, middle, and end of work. Covariance analysis was applied to determine the effect of the independent variables on fitness-for-work and fatigue. The results show that work shift and individual fitness significantly influence fitness-for-work (p < 0.05). However, none of the independent variables significantly affect fatigue, even though fitness-for-work and fatigue are strongly correlated (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). These results proved the role of fitness-for-work as an intermediate factor in fatigue. We suggest that there should be a shift in strategy for reducing the risk of accident-related fatigue, from fatigue monitoring directly to fitness-for-work screening. Eventually, the practical implementations of the findings are discussed comprehensively. \u00a9 2022 KIIE.",

      "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in diagnosing brain cancers is widespread. Because of the variety of angles and clarity of anatomy, it is commonly employed. If a brain tumor is malignant or secondary, it is a high risk, leading to death. These tumors have an increased predisposition for spreading from one place to another. In detecting brain abnormality form such as a tumor, from a magnetic resonance scan, expertise and human involvement are required. Previous, the image segmentation of brain tumors is widely developed in this field. Suppose we could somehow use an automatic brain tumor detection technology to identify the presence of a tumor in the brain without requiring human intervention. In that case, it will give us a leg up in the treatment process. This research proposed two stages to identify the brain tumor in MRI; the first stage was the image enhancement process using Clip Limit Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to segment the brain MRI. The second one was classifying the brain tumor on MRI using Visual Geometry Group-16 Layer (VGG-16). The CLAHE was used in some instances, there were CLAHE applied in FLAIR image on green color, and CLAHE applied in Red, Green, Blue (RGB) color space. The experimental result showed the highest performance with accuracy, precision, recall, respectively 90.37%, 90.22%, 87.61%. The CLAHE method in RGB Channel and the VGG-16 model have reliably on predicted oligodendroglioma classes in RGB enhancement with precision 91.08% and recall 95.97%. \u00a9 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Our findings show that there is a significant positive relationship between family communication patterns and family resilience, with preference to conversation orientations. All family types were identified as having a relationship with family resilience with different uniqueness in their resilience processes. With the relationship between these two concepts, perhaps the concept of communication patterns in the family can become a theoretical framework that binds the literature on family resilience in a sample of families with deaf children.

The complexity is a prime concern considering its implementation in a machine-to-machine (M2M) communication involving limited capacity devices. Since these devices have low processing power, so practical implementation of SCMA needs to be optimised for better performance. This paper proposes an SCMA decoder with a soft demapping technique to reduce the computational complexity, providing better performance. To improve the stability of SCMA system for M2M communication, this paper proposes the use of noise variance threshold \u03c8, to handle the system's stability. Results confirmed that the proposed soft demapper-based SCMA reduced the execution time to 33% and the iteration number to 63% compared to the conventional SCMA scheme deploying message passing algorithm (MPA)-based decoding. The proposed SCMA provides an improvement of 2.5 dB at a BER of 10-3 under the block Rayleigh fading channels and an improvement of approximately 1.1 dB at a BER of 10-5 dB under the fast Rayleigh fading channels. The improvements come from the fast convergence of iterative decoding using a soft demapper supported by a variance threshold \u03c8 that avoids the duality decision at the border of the decision area.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

It makes the vendor becomes a dominant entity, and customers are supplied by its own vendor exclusively. That is why most studies in VMI implement a single-vendor-single-customer or single-vendor-multi-customer scenario. In certain conditions, this exclusiveness can increase lost sales. Besides, most of them implement a single product scenario. In this work, we develop VMI model for the multi-vendor-customer-product scenario. This model is developed based on the collaborative multi-agent system. The relationship between vendors and customers is many-to-many. This work aims to reduce lost sales and maintain efficiency in the inventory. The continuous review (r, Q) policy is used as the replenishment model.

      "Crackles is one of the types of adventitious lung sound heard in patients with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or cystic fibrosis. Pulmonary crackles of discontinuous short duration appear on inspiration, expiration, or both. To differentiate these pulmonary crackles, the medical staff usually uses a manual method, called auscultation. Various methods were developed to recognize pulmonary crackles and distinguish them from normal pulmonary sounds to be applied in digital signal processing technology. This paper demonstrates a feature extraction method to classify pulmonary crackle and normal lung sounds using Support Vector Machine (SVM) method using several kernels by performing spectrograms of the pulmonary sound to generate the frequency profile. Spectrograms with various resolutions and 3-fold cross-validation were used to divide the training data and the test data in the testing process. The resulting accuracy ranges from 81.4%-100%. More accuracy values of 100% are generated by a feature extraction in several SVM kernels using 256 points FFT with three variations of windowing parameters compared to 512 points, where the best accuracy of 100% was produced by STFT-SVM method. This method has a potential to be used in the classification of other biomedical signals. The advantages of that are that the number of features produced is the same as the N-point FFT used for any signal length, the flexibility in the STFT parameters changes, such as the type of window and the window's length. In this study, only the Keiser window was tested with specific parameters.

      "This paper discusses an autonomous robot navigation system for the gas source localization problem in an unknown and GPS-denied environment to find a single gas source transported in turbulent wind flow using mobile robot olfaction (MRO). A new autonomous navigation system method is proposed by combining simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), gas distribution mapping (GDM), and anemotaxis. We developed two destination evaluation algorithms for the navigation system, frontier-multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and Anemotaxis-GDM, to drive the robot towards a gas source. The frontier-MCDM uses to select destination candidates for gas contaminant discovery. The Anemotaxis-GDM is used for gas source tracking when the robot's gas sensor detects gas contamination. The GSL process ends after the declaration of the gas source. The simulation results for three different environments with one gas source validate the effectiveness of the frontier-MCDM and anemotaxis-GDM algorithms. The simulation results show that the frontier-MCDM algorithm has a 60% success rate in finding gas contamination compared to the FFD-IG_CL strategy (13.3%) and frontier-IG_CL strategy (20%). The evaluation of anemotaxis-GDM algorithm simulation results based on the average accuracy index indicates that the robot's final pose is close to the gas source. The average simulation success ratio is 71.1%. \u00a9 2022, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. All rights reserved.",

      "Sleep analysis is often used to identify sleep-related human health. In many cases, sleep disorders could cause a particular disease. One of the approaches to detect sleep disorders is by investigating human sleep stages. However, the selection of the proper electrocardiogram (ECG) features is still considered challenging and becomes an issue to achieve the performance of the algorithm used. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate which ECG features are very significant to the performance of the algorithm. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) method has been utilized to classify sleep stages into two classes namely awake and sleep. In order to improve the classification performances, an optimization method of grid search was used to find the best parameters of the SVM. Feature selection of information gain was then used to find the most significant ECG features. To validate the performance results, one leave-subject out cross-validation has been conducted during the implementation. There were ten subjects involved in this implementation. The ECG signals from those ten subjects were used to differentiate awake from sleep state. Based on the results, our method obtained an average accuracy of 85.46% a precision of 84.05% and a recall of 85.44% respectively. \u00a9 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Although deep learning models have shown that they can provide good results in identifying diseases from medical imagery, they suffer from the vulnerability of adversarial attacks, making them perform poorly. Several techniques can be applied to improve defense against such attacks. One of which is adversarial training (AT) which trains a deep learning model using the input's gradient used to generate noises to the input image and Deep k-Nearest Neighbor (DkNN) that enforces prediction's conformity based on nearest neighbor voting on each layer's representation. This work tries to improve the defense against adversarial attacks by combining AT and DkNN.

      "Influenza is a contagious pathogen caused by the ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus and attacks the respiratory tract. This disease is still one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity due to the continuous emergence of new virus variants. One of the causes of the emergence of this new virus is the coinfection of two different strains. Apart from the emergence of new variants, several coinfection cases with other pathogens are reported with severe conditions. We constructed an SI1I2I3R1R2R3model to describe the coinfection of influenza and other respiratory pathogen transmissions by considering aspects of waning immunity, reinfected with the different pathogen and coinfected individuals. Analysis of this model reveals four equilibria: disease-free, two boundary endemics, and coexistence equilibria. The first three equilibria are expressed explicitly, along with the basic reproductive ratio. Stability conditions for boundary equilibria are shown analytically for the case with no coinfection and the case of symmetry. These conditions provide possible bifurcation points for numerical coexistence exploration and the nature of their stability. Numerical simulations show that no coexistence equilibrium exists in the case of no coinfection. As with coinfection, stable coexistence occurs for a relatively large coinfection rate, and Hopf bifurcations appear at two different values of infection rate of each pathogen. Stable limit cycles exist for pathogen infection rates between the two Hopf points. We also identify the periods of limit cycle increases as the infection rate of pathogen increases and decreases after reaching the maximum value. \u00a9 2021",

The results also imply that there is no single algorithm that is the best in solving all kinds of problems. \u00a9 2022. All Rights Reserved."

      "Traditional approaches to recommendation systems involve using collaborative filtering and content-based techniques which make use of the similarities between users and items respectively. Such approaches evolved to encapsulate model-based latent factor (LF) algorithms that use matrix decomposition to ingest a user-item matrix of ratings to generate recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on 3D LF model and tensor decomposition method for devising personalized recommendations driven from additional contextual features. We also present our stacking method for a tensor generation prior to incorporating LF models. We validate our proposed personalized recommender using two real-world datasets. Our experimental results showed that additional contextual features can help to personalize recommendations while maintaining similar or better performance compared to conventional 2D LF methods. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the importance of the quality of the contextual features to be used in 3D LF models. In addition, our experiments show the effective performance of our new stacking method on computation time and accuracy of the proposed recommender. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

      "Renewable Energy Sources are an effective alternative to the atmosphere-contaminating, rapidly exhausting, and overpriced traditional fuels. However, RESs have many limitations like their intermittent nature and availability at far-off sites from the major load centers. This paper presents the forecasting of wind speed and power using the implementation of the Feedforward and cascaded forward neural networks (FFNNs and CFNNs, respectively). The one and half year\u2019s dataset for Jhimpir, Pakistan, is used to train FFNNs and CFNNs with recently developed novel metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a Bat algorithm (BA) named HPSOBA, along with a modified hybrid PSO and BA with parameter-inspired acceleration coefficients (MHPSO-BAAC), without and with the constriction factor (MHPSO-BAAC-\u03c7). The forecasting results are made for June\u2013October 2019. The accuracy of the forecasted values is tested through the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The graphical and numerical comparative analysis was performed for both feedforward and cascaded forward neural networks that are tuned using the mentioned optimization techniques. The feedforward neural network was achieved through the implementation of HPSOBA with a mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error of 0.0673, 6.73%, and 0.0378, respectively. Whereas for the case of forecasting through a cascaded forward neural network, the best performance was attained by the implementation of MHPSO-BAAC with a MAE, MAPE and RMSE of 0.0112, 1.12%, and 0.0577, respectively.

The implementation of sound-data-based anomaly detection is an unduly complicated process since factory-collected sound data are frequently corrupted and affected by ordinary production noises. The use of acoustic methods to detect the irregularities in systems has a long history. Unfortunately, limited reference to the implementation of the acoustic approach could be found in the failure detection of industrial machines. This paper presents a systematic review of acoustic approaches in mechanical failure detection in terms of recent implementations and structural extensions.

Surface observation of the coating TiO2 showed that the dip-coating method has a better result than the spray coating method. All the glass surfaces can be covered by TiO2 perfectly, and this process did not affect the photocatalytic activity. Almost 100% of 4 ppm Rhodamine B could be decomposed by immobilized TiO2.

There are 10 million cases of cancer deaths based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Chemotherapy as a cancer treatment began in 1940 and has been successful since its inception. However, this treatment can be bad for the body in the long term. So, new drug designs are needed to overcome these impacts. Generally, anti-cancer drugs can be developed by considering Cyclin-Dependent Kinases 2 (CDK2) as the target. In designing a new drug, one method that can be used to accelerate the process is the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) method.

      "Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been widely studied for biometric recognition (or subject identification) applications over the past decade. Many techniques have been offered as well, from traditional computing to machine learning techniques. However, most studies evaluate their proposed models by independently separating the datasets between healthy (normal) and unhealthy (abnormal/arrhythmia) heart conditions. Some studies even used the ECG signal datasets from subjects only under healthy heart conditions. We believe that developing an ECG-based biometric system that includes the heart, both under healthy and unhealthy conditions, is highly needed since the users might be in both conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature, which considers the combination of the dataset of ECG signals from subjects under the healthy heart and unhealthy (arrhythmia) conditions in training, validation, and even testing processes. We combined the datasets from MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia databases obtained from Physionet. From the combination of those databases, we obtained a total of 32,628 datasets from 89 subjects which were later modeled using a machine learning technique, i.e., one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CONV1D). This study aims to build a light-weight yet reliable ECG-based biometric system by implementing only two layers of the convolutional neural network into those joined datasets. We evaluated the model's performance with k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) and yielded the accuracy and F1-scores of 99.8% And 99.8% respectively. We also proved that our model is a good fitting (not under/over-fitting) by providing the visualization plot of accuracy and loss. These findings show that our model is robust enough for ECG-based subject identification, which can be implemented for healthy and unhealthy heart conditions. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

This study was prompted by a desire to find answers to existing problems such as landfill waste and dwindling petroleum supply by using cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) reinforcement in the polymer matrix of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to address environmental challenges. The purity of the material obtained was investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the Tyndall effect. Three different weight percentage (wt. %) of CNC was prepared (2 wt.%, 4 wt.% and 6 wt.%) then added to 5 wt.% of PVA solution. The prepared nanocomposites were characterized using optical microscopy, Tyndall effect and transparency test. The thermal properties of the nanocomposite were identified using thermogravimetric analysis. As a result, these environmentally benign bio- nanocomposites may be suitable for industrial-scale manufacture of food packaging materials. \u00a9 2022 Author(s)."

      "In medical imaging, the application of retinal images demands a lot of retinal photos to analyze and requires efficient compression techniques for retinal image storage. Retinal images must meet stringent quality requirements for clinical data to be accurate and dependable. This paper proposes a compressive sampling (CS) framework for color retinal image (CRI) compression, which relies on spread spectrum Fourier sampling (SSFS) and total variant (TV)-based reconstruction method with three loops of RGB color space, referred to as RGB-TV. In CS, two procedures are performed, i.e., compression and CS reconstruction. In compression steps, SFFS is performed to get a compressed signal from the original CRI with a high compression ratio (CR). While in CS reconstruction, TV-norm and TV proximal operator are exploited for problem optimization to recover original CRI from a compressed signal. In addition, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and reconstruction time are investigated for the performance metrics of the proposed RGB-TV. The computer simulation result shows that the proposed RGB-TV with a set of CRI of size 512 by 512 pixels can compress until CR = 10 which obtains mean SNR of 22 dB, SSIM 0.84, and reconstruction time of 2.2 seconds.  \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

      "The thermodynamic picture describing the formation mechanism of bicontinuous concentric lamellar (bcl) nanostructured silica particles, bcl silica, was investigated thoroughly. A series of classical kinetics of bcl silica by varying the synthesis time were employed to observe the morphological evolution of bcl silica. The formation mechanism of bcl silica is proposed as the hydrolysis and condensation reactions in the reverse micelle, followed by the phase segregation process. The images of the whole part and the cross-section of bcl silica reveal that bcl silica can be obtained just 30 min after the synthesis starts. The particle morphology evolves from bicontinuous lamellar (bl) morphology, with the absence of the dense part in the center of the particle, to bicontinuous concentric lamellar (bcl) morphology. The theoretical part of this study is focused on the phase segregation process of the mixture. This process is divided thermodynamically into several reversible processes based on the reduced Helmholtz free energy state function. The type of the lamellar orientation (i.e., parallel or perpendicular orientation) changed as the stacked lamellae changed in thickness and was followed by the decrease in the free energy. It was merely shown that the segregation of the thin slab of the lamellar polysiloxane stack favors the perpendicular orientation. In contrast, the thick slab of the lamellar polysiloxane stack yields a complex lamellar structure consisting of perpendicular and parallel orientations. A lamellar polymer confined between two planar substrates can experience a topological transformation into a sphere due to an unfavorable environment, i.e., high surface tension. After the topological transformation, lamellae with a perpendicular orientation form bicontinuous lamellae, whereas the complex lamellar structure transforms into a bicontinuous concentric lamellar morphology. \u00a9 2022 American Chemical Society",

      "Due to increasing number of users and network traffics, video conference services can experience downtime in case of overloading request to video conference servers. To avoid this, an infrastructure that can replicate itself is for mitigating the risk of service downtime. The infrastructure is built using a container orchestration tool called Kubernetes that runs on Digital Ocean and Linode which functions as Cloud Services. This paper discusses the design of a Kubernetes cluster in which there are two Data Centers originating from two different countries. The Data Center can accommodate several Kubernetes nodes where each node accommodates one pod that can run one application through an intermediary service. In addition, nodes are equipped with the auto-scaling feature, i.e., ability to replicate pods and resize computational resources automatically, which can increase the high availability of the infrastructure and mitigate the risk of downtime. As for the experiment, The WebRTC service is observed by adjusting several parameters, which are QoS (delay, jitter, packet loss), CPU and memory usages, and the number of pods. The experimental results show that the number of pods before the existence of HPA was one while after the existence of HPA there were four pods. The highest number of errors before the HPA was 490 responses/sec, while after the HPA there were 11 responses/sec. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

We show that in addition to the inherent off-axis aberrations that occur due to the hyperbolic phase profile of the metasurface, the focusing performance is significantly degraded due to the meta-atoms' angular dispersion. To obtain insights into how the angular and spectral bandwidth of meta-atoms relate to the metasurface focusing performance, point dipole models are used which incorporate different aspects of the meta-atoms' angular response. It is emphasized that despite the meta-atoms being designed under the assumption that they support a single dipolar resonance, other resonances exist within the meta-atom geometry and become stronger at oblique incidence. These resonances disturb the designed phase and amplitude responses, resulting in lower focusing efficiency at higher incident angles. The modeling of higher order modes leads to good agreement with the experimental measurements, confirming that angular dispersion of the meta-atoms is the dominant mechanism in determining off-axis aberrations.  \u00a9 1963-2012 IEEE.",

      "Underwater Visible light communication (UVLC) is a network communication wirelessly where information is transmitted employing light through visible waves; in this case, the light source comes from a light-emitting diode (LED) as a transmitter underwater. VLC has several advantages over radio frequency technology, such as safer communication because light propagation cannot penetrate the wall, so it is difficult to do hacking, easy to get a license, relatively build cheap cost, and has no side effects on health. However, VLC has several limitations, one of which is the narrow bandwidth modulation. VLC undergoes a distribution of modulated bandwidth to allocate against each user. This bandwidth sharing has an impact on reduced system capacity. This study applied non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to increase system capacity. This research analyzes the performance of the two best power allocation methods in a water medium, including gain ratio power allocation (GRPA) and static power allocation (SPA). In the results obtained in the NOMA-UVLC power allocation value, GRPA is more stable than SPA power allocation. Then applying residue in the successive interference cancellation (SIC) process will result in a decrease in system capacity compared to no residue in the SIC process. This study found that the GRPA power allocation is more stable in capacity performance compared to the application of SPA power allocation. Average capacity increase of 48.5% in GRPA power allocation. \u00a9 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.",

Direct measurement of soil water content, such as the gravimetric method on large areas, requires time and cost. The remote sensing technology can potentially be applied for measuring a large area. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been studied to measure soil water content. However, the presence of vegetation can act as an obstacle and significantly influence the detection results. This influence can cause a decrease in the accuracy of the detection results. Therefore, the presence of vegetation needs to be considered in estimating the soil water content.

Therefore, we propose evaluating tree-based pipeline optimization (TPOT) as the classification model creation automation for credit card approval in this study. The data used is 690, namely the credit card approval dataset sourced from Kaggle, which we obtained from the University of California learning machine and is publicly available. Then we compare the TPOT result model with the credit card approval classification from the related paper as a benchmark, namely na\u00efve Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. The test results show that the TPOT model of credit card approval classification has higher accuracy than the benchmark model of the related research. The results of the TPOT have accuracy = 0.89. While the accuracy of na\u00efve Bayes, SVM, and decision tree are 0.823, 0.852, and 0.796, respectively.

All NDN nodes can store content in their content store. Therefore, it can reduce the latency of content retrieval by the user. The caching function can cope with the increase in big data traffic, such as video, which is predicted to dominate more than 79% of traffic on the network. Caching on NDN offers a solution by sending large content into smaller chunks of content, but there is no specific standard for setting the right chunk size. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth evaluation of chunk size allocation in NDN content stores and collaborate with several caching strategies. The test was carried out at the emulation level using Mininet-NDN. The study's results prove that sending chunk-size content can improve NDN performance compared to full-size content. The first topology shows that the transmission delay decreases when sending content chunks. Then the Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) obtained is higher than sending full-size content. In the second topology, uniform and various content size adjustments show promising results when using the Leave Copy Everywhere (LCE) cache strategy.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

In this research, we offer an ECG-based authentication approach as biometrics to simulate a personal identification system. The dispersion entropy approach is provided as a feature extraction method of signal complexity. The validation of the performance system is carried out using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) combined with 5-fold and 10-fold Cross-Validation (CV). A feature selection scenario is also applied to determining the best performance. The raw ECG signal is denoised using a High Pass Filter (HPF) with a cutoff frequency of 0.5 Hz and a Low Pass Filter (LPF) with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz, then normalized to obtain an amplitude range of 0-1. The signal is segmented into ten segments with 6 seconds long and 50% overlap, then decomposed into five levels using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). DisEn is calculated for each decomposition signal. This result value is a feature vector in the validation process.

The two models give satisfactory performance because the CC values are above 0.95, and both models' RMSE and MAPE are lower than 2. Moreover, the GRU algorithm is more efficient for short-term forecasting. Besides, the ANFIS model improves its effectiveness when the forecasting is longer.

Therefore that, we need a method to save energy, namely by using query optimization. This method is a process to analyze a query to determine what resources are required by the query and to identify if the use of these resources can be optimized by reducing the amount of data without significantly changing the output. In this paper, the authors propose a query optimization by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method for save energy on the device. First, the temperature sensors collect data from a room. Then the data collected from the temperature sensor is used to generate a matrix for PCA. After the data is made into a matrix, a covariance matrix is decomposed to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. After getting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, a new variable is determined, namely the Principal Component (PC) value to determine how many data will be reduced. The experimental results show that the NMSE value is not too large despite having 3 dimensionality reduced.

However, cybersecurity researchers have not profoundly studied the practical application of government data security requirements (e.g. data confidentiality) in service level agreements (SLAs) in the context of an outsourced scenario. The relationships with external service providers are usually established through SLAs as trust-enhancing instruments. However, there is a concern that existing SLAs mainly focus on the system availability and performance aspects but overlook cybersecurity requirements (e.g. data security) in SLAs. Such an understanding is essential to develop government SLA data confidentiality requirements into the formulation of security-related SLAs. We seek to provide insights by developing and conducting a grounded adaptive Delphi method (GADM) with 35 government participants through group discussions and individual sessions. The work on the Indonesian Government's data confidentiality requirements was used as a case study. This paper provides insights into three understandings of the increasing considerations of the Government's data confidentiality requirements in SLA definitions. The three perceptions of security-related SLAs are the target of protection, the data confidentiality risks and the government SLA data confidentiality requirements. Our findings play important implications for a better understanding of how to incorporate data confidentiality requirements according to perceived threats for government data classification in security-SLAs.

The presence of Internet of Things (IoT) technology is a big breakthrough for the problems that exist in society. With IoT, it is easier for people to monitor and control their plants at any time remotely. This study carried out the development of a prototype of an IoT-based automation system of plant watering for chili plants in a Greenbox. The prototype design of this research automation system is a cartesian robot with X and Y axes. The prototype performs automation depending on the input value of soil moisture or soil pH from the sensor. The result of this research is the achievement of an automation system for watering or giving liquid fertilizer to the Greenbox containing chili plants. The automation is based on input from sensor results. The obtained accuracy of the prototype reaches 95.53% for the X-axis and 99.15% for the Y-axis. The application of this prototype automation system is considered efficient in the use of human power. The quality of data transmission received is also quite good.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

The CNN model cites word embedding and emoji embedding features that reflect the dependence on temporary short-term sentiment. At the same time, LSTM builds long-term sentiment relationships between words and emojis.

      "There have been many studies that offer smart lighting control for the office. However, there is still room for improvement to enhance the performance of previous studies. This study proposes using a camera and SSD MobileNet object localization to detect the location of people in a room and control the lights according to the person's position. The smart lighting system is built based on the Internet-of-things (IoT) architecture by implementing the Raspberry Pi (Raspi) and Raspi Camera for image capture and localization. The Raspi communicates with the smart lighting controller consisting of led lights, relays, and NodeMCU. The test bed of this research is an office room, where we create five zones inside it. One light controller controls the illumination of each zone. The test scenario is to ask a person to sit in each zone and sample the light controller 100 times. Then is to gather another 100 samples per zone with no one in the zone. True positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) are the metrics to measure the performance of the proposed system. The test results show that the performance of smart lighting control in each zone is TPR=0.942 and TNR=0.956. Our research contributes to smart lighting control in the office room using a camera and object localization with better performance than existing research.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

In this study, Fitts\u2019 method was used for such interaction in a virtual environment, and the applicability of Fitts\u2019 law in 3D virtual environments was also considered. An experiment was using two modes of interaction (direct interaction and indirect interaction) that utilize different techniques depending on how users interact with a 3D object. Both interaction techniques were applied with three indexes of difficulty and three egocentric target distances (distance from the user to the target). Movement time and throughput were measured for each interaction technique. The results showed that the direct pointing technique is more efficient for interaction with targets close to the user, while the indirect cursor technique may be a viable option for targets further away from the user. The throughput was found to be significantly higher for the direct pointing technique compared to the indirect cursor technique. The results of mean movement time were highly correlated with the targets\u2019 index of difficulty for all interaction techniques, which is supporting evidence that Fitts\u2019 law can be applied to interactions in 3D virtual environments.

      "Radiosonde data, which includes surface wind speed (SWS), temperature, and wind profiles used in this study are data at Soekarno-Hatta airport (Cengkareng) in Jakarta. The data period is January to June 2020 used to evaluate the shear of wind direction, shear of wind speed, and Richardson number as the atmospheric parameters that are significantly noticed in flight. In aviation, the Richardson number is used as a rough measure of air turbulence, which values below unity indicating significant turbulence. The surface wind speed can be evaluated directly from the observation data. In contrast, the shears of wind direction and wind speed are determined by calculating the differences in every meter in a vertical direction (from the surface to 10\u00a0km). The result shows that the minimum and maximum wind speeds are 0 and 20\u00a0ms\u22121, respectively. During this period, there was an event where the surface wind speed exceeded the threshold value of safe surface wind speed for flight (15\u00a0ms\u22121). Moreover, both the shears of wind speed and wind direction are far below the threshold value. Based on the analysis of turbulence using the Richardson number, the percentage of turbulence events is about 53%. This situation occurs under stable conditions characterized by the CAPE < 1000\u00a0J\u00a0kg\u22121(no-convective activity) and unstable conditions (CAPE > 1000\u00a0J\u00a0kg\u22121). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in results related to Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) phase difference and Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation (MJO) amplitude difference.

      "In this work, we propose a drone-based sensor information gathering system that utilizes an aerial drone to wirelessly transfer an electromagnetic (EM) wave signal toward a battery-less forward-scatter tag device with multiple antennas. The proposed tag device is designed to harvest the EM signal from the drone as a source of power, and at the same time to reuse the EM signal for the data transmission. We propose a beam-rotation forward-scattering algorithm for the data transmission, which creates the main beam rotating along the azimuth plane. In the proposed algorithm, data are transmitted from the tag device to the tag reader by mapping each bit of information to varying beam rotation speeds. A unique hardware design of the forward-scatter tag device is proposed in this article, and it has been fabricated and implemented for wireless power transfer (WPT) and data transmission experiments. By experiment, we have verified that power is successfully harvested by the proposed tag device, with the average power conversion efficiency rated at 57%. The proposed tag device is able to transmit the sensor data to the tag readers without the knowledge of the location of the tag readers. We have tested the proposed beam-rotation forward-scattering communication at up to 500 m communication distance and shown that the sensor data can successfully be delivered. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.",

This research will be a starting point for combining SCSE with Scrum to produce a new framework that takes advantage of both. The main objective of this research is to determine how SCSE can be used in an agile development environment to produce a service computing system with fast delivery. The research methodology we use is Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM). A system development project has been tested using the proposed framework for one initial release with good results. A survey with the quantitative result has also been conducted among several stakeholders in system development to evaluate the proposed framework. As a result of this study, a framework is proposed to guide system development in an agile manner for creating services computing systems.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

      "Influenza is a contagious pathogen caused by the ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus and attacks the respiratory tract. This disease is still one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity due to the continuous emergence of new virus variants. One of the causes of the emergence of this new virus is the coinfection of two different strains. Apart from the emergence of new variants, several coinfection cases with other pathogens are reported with severe conditions. We constructed an SI1I2I3R1R2R3model to describe the coinfection of influenza and other respiratory pathogen transmissions by considering aspects of waning immunity, reinfected with the different pathogen and coinfected individuals. Analysis of this model reveals four equilibria: disease-free, two boundary endemics, and coexistence equilibria. The first three equilibria are expressed explicitly, along with the basic reproductive ratio. Stability conditions for boundary equilibria are shown analytically for the case with no coinfection and the case of symmetry. These conditions provide possible bifurcation points for numerical coexistence exploration and the nature of their stability. Numerical simulations show that no coexistence equilibrium exists in the case of no coinfection. As with coinfection, stable coexistence occurs for a relatively large coinfection rate, and Hopf bifurcations appear at two different values of infection rate of each pathogen. Stable limit cycles exist for pathogen infection rates between the two Hopf points. We also identify the periods of limit cycle increases as the infection rate of pathogen increases and decreases after reaching the maximum value. \u00a9 2021",

      "In recent years, the silent killer disease, defined as a non-communicable disease, has become a frequent topic discussed in many academic discussions. Although this disease is not transferable from one to another, starting from 1990, the increment trend was annually published by the world statistic data for this disease, e.g., heart attack and stroke. The more significant consequence of these two diseases is to disable one or more human capabilities. One of the stroke disease effects is becoming disabled from hearing. Speech disabilities are the focus of this proposed study in this paper. Since the person diagnosed as a stroke patient requires attending the recovery session or rehabilitation session, the rehabilitation center must prepare and provide a sound module and system to help the patient regain their capability. Rehabilitation is an alternative path to gradually giving routine practice to the patient to improve their capability back. For this purpose, the rehab center requires a quantity of time to provide the patient to attend the training session. The training, however, is conducted in two ways, physically and virtually. For the Malaysia stroke patient, the training for pronouncing the vowel in the Malay language is crucial in getting back the speaking capability. Since the Malay language has 6 types of vowels, which are/a/,/e/,/\u00ea/,/i/,/u/, and/o/. Here, there is a limitation to smartly recognizing the difference between the two/e/vowels.

Seismic data acquisition typically produces a significant data size. Seismic files within a survey may include useless noisy traces that increase the file size. Noisy traces have some noticeable features which can be exploited to aid the denoising process. In this work, the features were formulated based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to automatically distinguish excellent traces from noisy traces. PCA projects the seismic trace features to a lower dimension with only two features. To classify and detect noisy traces, we first select the dataset and generate Gaussian noise, then add the noise to the selected dataset and then normalize the traces before extracting the features: threshold algorithm, histogram algorithm, and zero-crossing algorithm and finally apply the PCA to obtain the projected data. In this work, two types of artificial noises were generated. It is shown that PCA is able to separate two types of noisy seismic traces.

PD is progressive in nature, and if undetected and untreated, the symptoms grow worse over time. Fortunately, PD can be detected early using gait features since the loss of motor control results in gait impairment. In general, techniques for capturing gait can be categorized as computer-vision-based or sensor-based. Sensor-based techniques are mostly used in clinical gait analysis and are regarded as the gold standard for PD detection. The main limitation of using sensor-based gait capture is the associated high cost and the technical expertise required for setup.

Recent advances in computer vision have enabled the tracking of body parts in videos in a markerless motion capture scenario via human pose estimation (HPE). Although markerless motion capture has been studied in comparison with gold-standard motion-capture techniques, it is yet to be evaluated in the prediction of neurological conditions such as PD. Hence, in this study, we extract PD-discriminative gait features from raw videos of subjects and demonstrate the potential of markerless motion capture for PD prediction. First, we perform HPE on the subjects using AlphaPose.

      "The lecture preparation process marks the start of lectures in the new semester. Telkom University has utilized online-based information technology, Integrated Academic Information System (i-Gracias). One of the applications available on i-Gracias is Outcome-Based Education (OBE). The significant increase in I-Gracias users indeed produces many data records in event logs. This data has become an opportunity to evaluate and improve the lecture preparation process already running. Data processing is needed to gain knowledge from the event log, one of which is process mining. This study starts from the discovery stage to conformance checking. Before the process mining is carried out, pre-processing of the data will be carried out to produce good quality logs and define the case id, activity, and timestamp.

The Heuristic Miner algorithm was adopted in this study because of its capability to manage event logs with noise and display the primary behavior of existing business processes. The conformance checking result shows a fitness value of 0.98, precision's value of 0.29, generalization's value of 0.51, and simplicity's value of 0.45 for the lecture preparation process.

      "The lecture preparation process marks the start of lectures in the new semester. Telkom University has utilized online-based information technology, Integrated Academic Information System (i-Gracias). One of the applications available on i-Gracias is Outcome-Based Education (OBE). The significant increase in I-Gracias users indeed produces many data records in event logs. This data has become an opportunity to evaluate and improve the lecture preparation process already running. Data processing is needed to gain knowledge from the event log, one of which is process mining. This study starts from the discovery stage to conformance checking. Before the process mining is carried out, pre-processing of the data will be carried out to produce good quality logs and define the case id, activity, and timestamp. Existing event logs will be processed using ProM tools using the Heuristic Miner Algorithm to model the process and achieve the best fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity values. The Heuristic Miner algorithm was adopted in this study because of its capability to manage event logs with noise and display the primary behavior of existing business processes.

      "On toll roads, there are several car drivers who often use the roadside of toll road as a lane for driving which should not be used unless there is an urgent situation, this can interfere with the interests of other road drivers who have more urgent interests who should use the roadside of the toll road, so far if this occurs violations on the roadside of the toll road, it is rare for toll officers to know the violation directly, it is still not effective enough because officers cannot go directly to secure the driver who commits a violation. By using a system that is used to detect violations on the roadside of toll road using the Deep Learning Faster Region based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) algorithm. The way it works is by processing the video recorded from CCTV on the HK TOLL APPS application, then the system will detect the vehicle that has committed a violation, if it is proven to have committed a violation, the system will provide a notification to the toll road officer via a Telegram Bot. The output obtained in this research is the system can properly detect vehicles that violate the rule on the roadside of the toll road. By using the model results from testing with several data partition training test schemes and configuration variables testing, obtained the model that has the best value with 90%:10% data partition, and configuration variables with Learning Rate 0.0004, Batch Size 1, Epoch 100.

Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the NaOH concentration and solid to liquor ratio (SL) at a maximum temperature of 100\u00a0\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure. The mathematical formula derived from RSM was based on 11 runs of the batch treatment.

So that users who do not understand the technical features of the product, can more easily express their needs. In this CRS, questions are generated using semantic reasoning. However, the functional requirements asked to the user are chosen from the candidate nodes randomly. The candidate nodes are a set of functional requirements questions that the user potentially likes. Thus, users will get questions about functional requirements that do not match their preferences. Thus, the system will give repeated questions and make the system inefficient. In this study, we overcome this problem by proposing a learning mechanism using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to generate questions.

      "Various variants of COVID-19 have entered Indonesia, such as the delta and the omicron variants. The delta variant has a higher severity than the omicron variant, but the transmission rate for the omicron variant is much faster. The government encourages citizens to get booster vaccines to reduce the effect of the delta and omicron variants. The booster vaccine produced a better effect on citizens than on people who received only the two doses. Therefore, in this study, we observe the transmission of COVID-19 and the vaccine locations on the sub-districts level using the clustering approach. The data we use are COVID-19 positive cases, died, treated, and self-isolated cases. Meanwhile, the vaccination data are 1st dose, 2nd doses, stage 3 of 1st dose, and stage 3 of 2nd doses. The Dunn Index and Hubert Index methods determined the best number of clusters before the clustering process. Silhouette and Davies Bouldin are used to find better clustering between Fuzzy C-Means, K-Means, and Partition Around Medoids (PAM). The results obtained from this study showed that the K-Means method was the best with the best number of clusters, namely 3. Jagakarsa and Kebon Jeruk entered high levels at the time of the delta variant due to the COVID-19 case and vaccination spread. However, Jagakarsa and Kebon Jeruk dropped to the intermediate level during the omicron variant. The benefit of this study is to help the government pay more attention to high COVID-19 cases and low vaccine distribution.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

In this research, CNT/CNC hybrid filler was prepared by mixing the 6 w.t% of CNC with 0.2 g, 1.2 g, 2.2 g, 3.2 g, and 4.2 g of carbon nanotubes, respectively. The hybrid nanofiller produced was labeled as 0.2 CNT/CNC, 1.2 CNT/CNC, 2.2 CNT/CNC, 3.2 CNT/CNC, and 4.2 CNT/CNC. Subsequently, the CNT/CNC hybrid nanofiller was added as the reinforcement in 5 w.t% of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix to produce the CNT/CNC/PVA nanocomposite films using the solvent casting method. The CNC/CNC hybrid filler was characterized using viscometer and stability test while the CNT/CNC/PVA nanocomposite films were characterized using optical microscope (OM) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The result showed that the stability of the hybrid filler could be sustained in one phase for up to 5 months. The highest viscosity of hybrid filler was at 4.2 g CNT/CNC hybrid nanofiller with 193.0 centipoises, cP. The morphology of CNT/CNC/PVA nanocomposite films from optical microscope and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) revealed homogenous dispersion of hybrid nanofiller within the PVA matrix, and demonstrated the viscosity became higher due to high amounts of CNT.

Therefore, this study evaluated the precoded OFDM (P-OFDM) system performance by considering the impact of CFO and IQ imbalance. P-OFDM performance evaluation is expressed in signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) and bit error rates (BER).

The results of the analysis and simulation show that P-OFDM is greater affected by the presence of CFO and IQ imbalance than conventional OFDM system. In AWGN channel, P-OFDM experiences different SINR for each subcarrier. This is different from conventional OFDM system, where all SINRs are the same for all subcarriers. In the FSRF channel, both the P-OFDM system and the OFDM system experience different SINR for each subcarrier, where the SINRs fluctuation in the P-OFDM system is much larger than in the OFDM system. \u00a9 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Fire cases that often occur require a system that is able to detect fires and provide information to users remotely to reduce the impact of fires. Along with the development of hardware technology such as computers, the use of GIS seems to be an effective shortcut in analyzing an event. Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized application workloads, offering declarative configuration and automation. This research designs a Google Maps API System tool for forest and land fires using a real-time database on microservices infrastructure with outputs in the form of fire locations and the results of sensor readings used. Broadly speaking, the processes that occur in the design of the location of forest fire points will be detected by sensors. Then firebase will store forest fire data which will simultaneously be updated on the website. Clients can see the point of forest fires through a browser on their respective desktops. Based on the results of the performance tests that have been carried out, it can be concluded that the use of Kubernetes microclusters can provide advantages when compared to those built monolithically, because Kubernetes microclusters have several advantages, namely having the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler feature, and the Kubernetes microcluster manages components and related services well. Then for each test performed, there was no significant change in memory usage. In the analysis of the results of the comparison data with 7 tests that have been carried out there are 6 tests which mean that the service built with the Kubernetes microcluster is superior to the monolithic one, namely hits per second 2354 ms, latency 3599 ms, response code 720 success code, cpu utilization 13.84%, error rate error rate 0.00%, and throughput 112/sec.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) has been seen to be a reliable Face Recognition technique. The (Formula presented.) Bayesian based on the Lasso algorithm has proven to be most effective in class identification and computation complexity. In this paper, we revisit classification algorithm and then recommend the group-based classification. The proposed modified algorithm, which is called as Group Class Residual Sparse Representation-based Classification (GCR-SRC), extends the coherency of the test sample to the whole training samples of the identified class rather than only to the nearest one of the training samples. Our method is based on the nearest coherency between a test sample and the identified training samples. To reduce the dimension of the training samples, we choose random projection for feature extraction. This method is selected to reduce the computational cost without increasing the algorithm\u2019s complexity. From the simulation result, the reduction factor ((Formula presented.)) 64 can achieve a maximum recognition rate about 10% higher than the SRC original using the downscaling method. Our proposed method\u2019s feasibility and effectiveness are tested on four popular face databases, namely AT&T, Yale B, Georgia Tech, and AR Dataset.

      "Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) has been seen to be a reliable Face Recognition technique. The (Formula presented.) Bayesian based on the Lasso algorithm has proven to be most effective in class identification and computation complexity. In this paper, we revisit classification algorithm and then recommend the group-based classification. The proposed modified algorithm, which is called as Group Class Residual Sparse Representation-based Classification (GCR-SRC), extends the coherency of the test sample to the whole training samples of the identified class rather than only to the nearest one of the training samples. Our method is based on the nearest coherency between a test sample and the identified training samples. To reduce the dimension of the training samples, we choose random projection for feature extraction. This method is selected to reduce the computational cost without increasing the algorithm\u2019s complexity. From the simulation result, the reduction factor ((Formula presented.)) 64 can achieve a maximum recognition rate about 10% higher than the SRC original using the downscaling method. Our proposed method\u2019s feasibility and effectiveness are tested on four popular face databases, namely AT&T, Yale B, Georgia Tech, and AR Dataset. GCR-SRC and GCR-RP-SRC achieved up to 4% more accurate than SRC random projection with class-specific residuals. The experiment results show that the face recognition technology based on random projection and group-class-based not only reduces the dimension of the face data but also increases the recognition accuracy, indicating that it is a feasible method for face recognition. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

      "During the Covid-19 pandemic, teaching and learning activities were carried out virtually. It has been running for more than one year. When the trend of Covid-19 cases decreased, onsite learning began to be trialed by implementing strict health protocols. One of the important parameters for the first screening is body temperature because 99% of Covid-19 patients have fever. Therefore, a student temperature measurement mechanism is needed before entering the school area. A number of temperature detectors should be located to prevent queues. A distributed real-time monitoring system as well as data records are required for daily evaluations. Therefore, in this study, a distributed system for measuring body temperature was designed and implemented with data recording. This system runs online real-time on an internet network client server application. This system consists of four temperature detectors connected to a mini-computer as data control and an access point to a dedicated network. All sensor nodes can send data simultaneously. A web server application is provided for data storage and access to the client. From testing the proposed system, it is known that the system can send real-time data with a delay of <150\u00a0ms on several measurements and other measurements >150\u00a0ms because it really depends on the quality of internet service. The application can run an alarm function if it finds a temperature exceeding the threshold. This system has been implemented in one of a private school in the city of Bandung. With this system, it is hoped that it can support onsite learning activities in schools. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

      "Glaucoma is a damaged optic nerve due to increased pressure on the eyeball. The cause is a mismatch between eye fluid (aqueous humor) produced and the amount of eye fluid secreted. Ophthalmologists usually detect glaucoma using Cup to Disc Ratio or CDR parameter. However, the calculation of CDR parameters is still done manually, usually done by trained doctors and relatively expensive and limited equipment. This study proposes a system that can classify glaucoma using the Convolutional Neural Network method with MobileNet architecture. MobileNet has two convolution parts: depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution. The function of the Depthwise Convolution is to apply a single convolution filter per input channel, while the function of the pointwise convolution is to build new features by calculating the linear combination of the input channels by applying the 1x1 convolution. The data used comes from rimone-r1 database. Result accuracy of the proposed method reaches 99%. Automated glaucoma classification can assist medical staff in identifying the best treatment for their patients.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

An inertial sensor (3 DOF accelerometer and 3 DOF gyroscope) is mounted on the upper abdomen, allowing the tilt value of the upper abdomen to be measured. CCF is aimed at overcoming the limitations of the linear CF method for online gyroscope estimation. Our proposed CCF algorithm compensates gyroscope bias with a nonlinear filter and then fuses it with accelerometer angle to obtain abdominal inclination. The CCF method performed better than the linear CF method in terms of respiratory rate error. While CCF increased estimation accuracy, it also appeared to be independent of attitude estimation parameters. The frequency of the CCF respiratory signal remained steady between 0.2 Hz and 0.4 Hz throughout the experiment, with a mean of 0.29 Hz. In other words, the results range between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, which is considered normal at 17 breaths per minute. \u00a9 2022 Bayu Erfianto and Achmad Rizal.",

For some of the current HAR approaches, 3D sensors are used as input extractors for the skeleton/body pose of the subject being monitored.

      "The human desire for high efficiency drives the development of technology in various sectors. The transportation and logistics sectors are the sector that is affected by the presence of automated mobile robots. Automated mobile robots in carrying out their duties require the use of several sensors or sensor fusion. The implementation of sensor fusion has a problem where each sensor has its own characteristics. With the Kalman Filter, the implementation of sensor fusion is getting better because it can estimate the position of the mobile robot not only based on one sensor. In this research, we proposed a mobile robot with Ackerman steering that can overcome the slip on the wheels and control the speed when turning. The outdoor localization of the mobile robot utilizes the GPS and Compass sensor via sensor fusion. Then, we design the PID controller to control the velocity and the direction using the Ziegler-Nichols method. The simulation and experiment results show the effectiveness of the velocity control, direction control, and sensor fusion using the Kalman filter for outdoor localization. The waypoint navigation can be achieved with a tolerance value of 1 meter.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "The human desire for high efficiency drives the development of technology in various sectors. The transportation and logistics sectors are the sector that is affected by the presence of automated mobile robots. Automated mobile robots in carrying out their duties require the use of several sensors or sensor fusion. The implementation of sensor fusion has a problem where each sensor has its own characteristics.

      "Digital photos are often defined as personal archives collected long ago and are stored on a large enough storage media such as an external hard disk or flash disk. Problems arise when someone wants to find photos of themselves or others in tons of photo collections. Searching manually, such as opening a photo file or folder one by one, will certainly be very troublesome. Based on these problems, this study designed an application for searching certain photos based on the similarity of the inserted face photo. This application is built for computer or laptop devices, which was developed by using the Python programming language and Dlib module that applied the face recognition method through the combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), FaceNet Embedding, and Triplet Loss for matching faces. The recognition scheme starts from face detection, face alignment, face encoding, and face classification stage. Our application is very handy to run in looking for particular face images on external storage compared to prior studies. We have done experimental research, demonstrating that the application can find almost all image files the user is looking for. In addition to the result in the form of an application, this study contributes to exploring the performance of the Dlib module, in terms of precision and recall rate, which could not recognize non-frontal face images well. We encourage other researchers to address this limitation in further studies. \u00a9 2022",

Despite its popularity, this method can be improved because inspecting a PCB with a template is inefficient. Currently, integrating the surface inspection system with the deep learning method is proving to be more effective in solving this problem. This paper examines three popular deep learning object recognition methods in order to determine which one is the most effective in terms of attention.

      "Crackles is one of the types of adventitious lung sound heard in patients with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or cystic fibrosis. Pulmonary crackles of discontinuous short duration appear on inspiration, expiration, or both. To differentiate these pulmonary crackles, the medical staff usually uses a manual method, called auscultation. Various methods were developed to recognize pulmonary crackles and distinguish them from normal pulmonary sounds to be applied in digital signal processing technology. This paper demonstrates a feature extraction method to classify pulmonary crackle and normal lung sounds using Support Vector Machine (SVM) method using several kernels by performing spectrograms of the pulmonary sound to generate the frequency profile. Spectrograms with various resolutions and 3-fold cross-validation were used to divide the training data and the test data in the testing process. The resulting accuracy ranges from 81.4%-100%. More accuracy values of 100% are generated by a feature extraction in several SVM kernels using 256 points FFT with three variations of windowing parameters compared to 512 points, where the best accuracy of 100% was produced by STFT-SVM method. This method has a potential to be used in the classification of other biomedical signals. The advantages of that are that the number of features produced is the same as the N-point FFT used for any signal length, the flexibility in the STFT parameters changes, such as the type of window and the window's length. In this study, only the Keiser window was tested with specific parameters.

Many customers use social media as a means of conveying their opinions on this accident, one of the social media used is twitter. Twitter is a service used by users to upload information in the form of text that contains sentiments from its users. However, Twitter itself has a character limit, which is only 280 characters. As a result of character restrictions, opinions expressed may contain vocabulary mismatches because they contain slang, abbreviations, emoji, etc. Because of this, it is difficult to understand the context of the opinions expressed. Therefore, Word2vec feature expansion is used to deal with the problem of vocabulary mismatch, which can result in word context. This study develops a Twitter sentiment classification system using the Word2vec feature expansion method with the Gradient Boost Decision Tree classification algorithm. The results of this study indicate that by using feature expansion in the classification algorithm, model performance has increases to 3.29% for accuracy, 3.35% for precision, 3.31% for recall, and 3.31% for f1-score.

The dataset has missing value and imbalanced class problems in which the previous research used complete case analysis for missing value and neglected imbalanced class problems within the dataset. The dataset has more than 5% missing values and has a significant amount of imbalance. The class that has the most amount of data has around 64% of the data, but the least amount of data only has 0.6% of the data. On the other hand, the dataset's missing values are randomly scattered among the data. This research proposed a preprocessing process to combine Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and tested it with three machine learning methods such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbour. As a result, the g-mean metrics for those three machine learning approaches improved from 0.2 percent to 3.8 percent.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

However, CNC's sensitivity to humid environments and lack of thermostability has proven to be a key obstacle to its adoption in various industries, including food packaging. In this study, PVA/CNC bio-nanocomposite films at various CNC contents (2\u20136 wt%) were prepared by solvent casting method, and their properties were characterized by Optical Microscopy (OM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Ultra-visible (UV\u2013vis) spectrophotometer. It was found that the addition of (2-6 wt%) of CNC within PVA improved the interfacial interactions between CNC and the blend to provide a clear micro-structure which was investigated through OM and FESEM. Additionally, the bio-nanocomposite films maintained high transparency level (transmittance of \u223c90 % in the visible region in UV\u2013vis), suggesting that the CNC were dispersed well within the PVA matrix.

It is essential to investigate to know if Turkey is promoting climate change as could be among the reason why it fails to work in line the agreement to reduce the global warming. The authors adopted quantile regression (QR) to study the linear relationship that exist among the selected variables in order to have a valid conclusion on the stand of the Turkey towards the control of global warming. Our findings are: A negatively significant relationship between the carbon emission and the agriculture in the all the quantiles except the 90% quantile which shows a positive relationship. Also, the ordinary least square (OLS) estimate which acts as a robust check to the quantile findings confirms a negative relationship between the carbon emission and agriculture. A positively significant relationship is established between energy use and carbon emission in all the quantiles. EU (energy use) is statistically significant for the 30, 40, 50, 70, 80 and 90% quantiles. EU is more statistically significant for the 90% quantile than lower quantiles. Again, a mixed (both positive and negative) relationship is established between foreign direct investment and carbon emission in all the quantiles which shows that FDI is impacting the Turkish environment a mixed manner. It shows that the foreign investors still engage in both clean and dirty production in Turkey. This finding gives support to both pollution halo/haven hypothesis (PHH) in Turkey. However, a 1% point increase in GDP per capita increases the carbon emission both in the 10% quantiles and OLS by 2.82 and 2.797% respectively. This shows a positive relationship that exist between GDP per capita and the carbon emission.

      "One critical problem in Indonesia's national joint courses program, initiated by the ministry of education and culture of Indonesia, is the lecturer-course assignment problem. Although the lecturer-course assignmentproblem has been studied widely as part of the education timetabling problem, no existing lecturer-courseassignment model suits this circumstance. The new cases in this program are as follows. First, this program isconducted online. Second, the participants are students and lecturers from different universities. Based on thisproblem, this work proposes a novel lecturer-course assignment model that suits this program. The lecturers'preferred courses and timeslots become hard constraints. The model has three objectives: (1) maximizing theeducational quality, (2) maximizing the lecturers' time preference, and (3) minimizing the number of unservedclasses. This model is developed by using integer linear programming and optimized by using cloud theory-basedsimulated annealing. This proposed model is then compared with the four previous lecturers-course assignmentmodels. The first model concerns about minimizing the number of unserved classes, while the second model focuseson maximizing the education quality. The maximum number of classes per course for every lecturer is considered inthe third model while balancing the lecturer\u2019s load (teach, research, community service) is the feature of the fourthmodel. The research concludes that the proposed model is appropriate for lecture-course assignment in Indonesia\u2019snational joint courses program compared to the previous models.

Iteration always starts from the starting point to obtain the following solution point, leading to the convergence point. This paper presents a new method to solve economic load dispatch problems by narrowing the minimum and maximum power limits between generator units. This idea approximates the solution point with a tiny space formed by the very narrow power limits of each generator. The methodology used is the distance between the minimum and maximum power limits of each generator divided into several segments. Then, the best segment is determined by the minimum total cost calculated based on the center point of the segment. Continue to the following iteration process until the best segment is the smallest. This iteration process is another artificial method that works without calculus calculations, so it does not depend on the objective function. This method has been validated using two generator units with differentiable objective functions, with calculation accuracy less than 0.00001 MW of the power distance of the generator limit, and the iteration stops at the $23^{\\mathrm {rd}}$ step. Furthermore, this method has been successfully applied to the nondifferentiable objective function, piecewise and valve point effects.  \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

Some machine learning tasks can be applied to potentially helping monitoring process. One of these tasks is anomaly detection. However, existing studies have not conducted anomaly detection properly in the field of oil and gas industry due to tendency of using plain techniques or unsuitable paradigms. To handle this, deep learning model of autoencoder type is implemented to detect anomalies on gas pipeline operational data. Specifically, the data used is 2 years long of hourly time series data which contains 17 features and 17520 datapoints. The autoencoder model will be trained to reconstruct the data with a minimum error. Once trained, the reconstructed data can be compared to the original data to detect any potential anomaly. This paper considers 6 different cases of model architecture while comparing the results using mean squared error to obtain the optimal model setup in the reconstruction process. To evaluate the model, we compute Euclidean distance between the reconstructed and original data as the anomaly score. By determining a threshold value of the score, we can identify the anomalies in the data.

      "Courier services have become a sector that has experienced a growth spurt during the Covid-19 pandemic. The soaring growth of courier services is due to e-commerce in Indonesia. Increased people's digital activities show this during the pandemic, including online or online shopping. Data from the Indonesian Ministry of Finance shows that purchase transactions via e-commerce increased 18.1 percent to 98.3 million, with a total transaction value of 9.9 percent to Rp20.7 trillion. Fast and efficient delivery and pick-up of goods is the core operation of courier services. The biggest challenge for courier service providers is how to compete with other companies that offer the same type of service. Service users are increasingly demanding the security and reliability of delivery services so that they can meet the expectations of service users. The expectations of service users used as targets for company achievement are (1) reliability (on time, accuracy, integrity), (2) convenience (collecting units, delivery coverage, operating hours), (3) services, and (4) cost. Based on the activities in courier services, the potential for errors or inefficiencies in processing time is in the pre-delivery activities. In the pre-delivery activity is also the initial activity used to input the data base, collect goods, distribute goods and so on. This research proposes that RFID Label technology can overcome errors and increase process time efficiency in shipping goods on courier services, especially in pre-delivery and delivery activities. \u00a9 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Service users are increasingly demanding the security and reliability of delivery services so that they can meet the expectations of service users. The expectations of service users used as targets for company achievement are (1) reliability (on time, accuracy, integrity), (2) convenience (collecting units, delivery coverage, operating hours), (3) services, and (4) cost. Based on the activities in courier services, the potential for errors or inefficiencies in processing time is in the pre-delivery activities. In the pre-delivery activity is also the initial activity used to input the data base, collect goods, distribute goods and so on. This research proposes that RFID Label technology can overcome errors and increase process time efficiency in shipping goods on courier services, especially in pre-delivery and delivery activities. \u00a9 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

      "Purpose: Zakat during the COVID-19 outbreak has played a vital role and has been significantly discussed in the virtual environment. Such information about zakat in the virtual world creates unstructured data, which contains important information and knowledge. This paper aims to discover knowledge related to zakat administration during the pandemic from the information in a virtual environment. Furthermore, the discussion is contextualised to the socio-economic debates. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study operated via text mining to discover knowledge of zakat administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Board of Zakat Republic of Indonesia (BAZNAS RI) is selected for a single case study. This paper samples BAZNAS RI\u2019s situation report on COVID-19 from its virtual website. The data consists of 40 digital pages containing 19,812 characters, 3,004 words and 3,003 white spaces. The text mining analytical steps are performed via RStudio. The following R packages, networkD3, igraph, ggraph and ggplot2 are used to run the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling. Findings: The machine learning analysis via RStudio results in the 16 topics associated with the 3 primary topics (i.e. Education, Sadaqah and Health Services). The topic modelling discovers knowledge about BAZNAS RI\u2019s assistance for COVID-19 relief, which may help the readers understand zakat administration in times of the pandemic from BAZNAS RI\u2019s virtual website. This finding may draw the theory of socio-economic zakat, which explains that zakat as a religious obligation plays a critical role in shaping a Muslim community's social and economic processes, notably during the unprecedented times of COVID-19. Research limitations/implications: This study uses data from a single zakat institution. Thus, the generalisation of the finding is limited to the sampled institution. Practical implications: This research is both theoretically and practically important for academics and industry professionals. This paper contributes to the novelty in performing text mining via R in gaining knowledge about the recent zakat administration from a virtual website. The finding of this study (i.e. the topic modelling) is practically essential for zakat stakeholders to understand the contribution of zakat in managing the COVID-19 impacts. Social implications: This work derives a theory of \u201csocio-economic zakat\u201d that explains the importance of a zakat institution in activating zakat for managing socio-economic issues during the pandemic. Thus, paying zakat to an authorised institution may actualise more maslahah (public interest) compared to paying it directly to the asnaf (zakat beneficiaries) without any measurement Originality/value: This study is among the pioneers in gaining knowledge from Indonesia\u2019s zakat management during the COVID-19 outbreak via text mining. The authors\u2019 way of analysing data from the virtual website using RStudio can advance Islamic economics literature. \u00a9 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

      "One of the many organs in the human body is the heart. The function of the heart is to pump blood all over the body. If the heart is suffering damage or interference, it could cause many harms to people starting from chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, and the worse is death. To prevent this is by doing a heart health check to get the treatment needed. However, the patients have to come to the hospital to do a heart health check, which costs a lot of money. Therefore, we propose another method of diagnosing heart disease. This study uses a machine learning bagging algorithm (random forest) to detect heart disease with two classes: no disease or disease. The evaluation results show that the bagging algorithm achieved 97.8% accuracy from the best optimal grid search parameters. It can be concluded that this proposed method can fairly discriminate heart disease.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "The TiO2 based solar cells researches have attracted a lot of attention due to the simple fabrication process and relatively low production cost. However, this type of solar cell has the disadvantage due to its large band gap of 3.1 eV which generates low sun light absorption. To overcome this problem, the TiO2 is usually incorporated with dye or other nanoparticles. In this study, micro-sized graphite was inserted into anatase-TiO2 solar cells using the doctor blade and spin-coating methods. The morphology and the effect of graphite insertion on TiO2 to the absorption spectrum are characterized by using scanning electron microscopy and UV-Vis, respectively. Meanwhile, the efficiency of solar cell is determined from the I-V curve characterization. Generally the I-V curve characteristics is affected by the mass of graphite insertion, Even though the observed highest efficiency is 0.052 %, the graphite insertion is found to increase the light absorption about 75 % when 0.4 gram graphite is inserted to 0.7 gram TiO2 and deposited using doctor blade method. Furthermore, the I-V curve characteristics and efficiency can be modified by depositing the sample using spin coating method which tends to produce higher open circuit voltage and smaller short circuit method. A 350 mV open circuit voltage is observed for 1000 rpm spin coating. A higher efficiency is obtained for smaller rpm. This study shows how graphite insertion affects the light absorption and electrical properties of anatase-TiO2 based solar cell. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).",

      "This study was conducted to examine the characteristics of acid deposition in Cipedes and Telkom University as an urban area and Tanjung Sari as a suburban area. The data used were wet deposition and dry deposition data from 2019 to 2020. Data processing was done using time series analysis. Calculation of the Fractional Acidity (FA), Neutralization Factor (NF), and the PMF 5 model were used to trace pollutant sources in urban and suburban areas. The results showed that the concentration of anions and cations for the Cipedes area was higher than at Telkom University and Tanjung Sari. The pH value Telkom Univ has a tendency more acidic than Cipedes and Tanjung Sari because the anion concentration contributing 52% of the total concentrations in Telkom Univ. The results of dry deposition using the passive sampling method showed that the concentrations of NO2and O3were the dominant gas concentrations in Cipedes, Telkom Univ, and Tanjung Sari. Fractional acidity shows that the acidity of rainwater in Cipedes, Telkom Univ, and Tanjung Sari can be neutralizing with the dominant neutralizing components were NH4+, Na+, and Ca2+. From the PMF model, this study found that local emission sources and long-distance emissions can affect the characteristics of acid deposition in urban and suburban areas. Local emissions such as traffic activity, industrial and biomass burning, and sea salt from ocean sources for long-range transport emissions. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

The EEG signals are used as an alternative method to help the improvement of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to detect stroke conditions. The energy distribution clarifies the relationship for each channel while converting the EEG signal into an energy distribution image. The Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and ANN-BP are used as a method for image feature values to get the optimal system feature after brain mapping using Power Spectrum Density (PSD). We evaluate the system performances via a series of computer simulations. We investigate the feature combination using GLCM by taking the best 11 features, i.e., contrast, correlation, variance, entropy, homogeneity, energy, sum variance, sum entropy, difference variance, difference entropy and inverse difference momentum with an accuracy equal to 61.25%. Thus, the GA uses to select the feature on GLCM in order to find the best combination for the BCI system in this study. We found the accuracy value of GA-GLCM equals 72.5% with features, i.e., contrast, correlation, homogeneity, energy, sum variance, and different variance, while the EEG signal is tested with accuracy equals 59%. The result shows that the BCI system can be optimized using the converted EEG signal into energy distribution images.

      "This research work is developed with interest on the performance of Turkish sustainable development amidst high inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) and excessive usage of fossil fuels (crude oil and gas). Turkey has been identified as among the countries yet to ratify their agreements with both Kyoto and Paris agreements in fight to reduce the global warming. It is essential to investigate to know if Turkey is promoting climate change as could be among the reason why it fails to work in line the agreement to reduce the global warming. The authors adopted quantile regression (QR) to study the linear relationship that exist among the selected variables in order to have a valid conclusion on the stand of the Turkey towards the control of global warming. Our findings are: A negatively significant relationship between the carbon emission and the agriculture in the all the quantiles except the 90% quantile which shows a positive relationship. Also, the ordinary least square (OLS) estimate which acts as a robust check to the quantile findings confirms a negative relationship between the carbon emission and agriculture. A positively significant relationship is established between energy use and carbon emission in all the quantiles. EU (energy use) is statistically significant for the 30, 40, 50, 70, 80 and 90% quantiles. EU is more statistically significant for the 90% quantile than lower quantiles. Again, a mixed (both positive and negative) relationship is established between foreign direct investment and carbon emission in all the quantiles which shows that FDI is impacting the Turkish environment a mixed manner. It shows that the foreign investors still engage in both clean and dirty production in Turkey. This finding gives support to both pollution halo/haven hypothesis (PHH) in Turkey. However, a 1% point increase in GDP per capita increases the carbon emission both in the 10% quantiles and OLS by 2.82 and 2.797% respectively. This shows a positive relationship that exist between GDP per capita and the carbon emission. GDP is statistically significant for all quantiles, and show that there is a strong relationship between CO2and GDP. Turkish sustainable policies should focus on promotion of clean FDI and agricultural practice with economic growth anchored on renewable energy sources. \u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

Again, a mixed (both positive and negative) relationship is established between foreign direct investment and carbon emission in all the quantiles which shows that FDI is impacting the Turkish environment a mixed manner. It shows that the foreign investors still engage in both clean and dirty production in Turkey. This finding gives support to both pollution halo/haven hypothesis (PHH) in Turkey. However, a 1% point increase in GDP per capita increases the carbon emission both in the 10% quantiles and OLS by 2.82 and 2.797% respectively. This shows a positive relationship that exist between GDP per capita and the carbon emission. GDP is statistically significant for all quantiles, and show that there is a strong relationship between CO2and GDP. Turkish sustainable policies should focus on promotion of clean FDI and agricultural practice with economic growth anchored on renewable energy sources. \u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Using a portfolio, an investor can manage the return and the risk of stock investments. Many methods have been developed to manage a portfolio. One of the most recent is Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In this paper, DRL is applied to construct a portfolio. The portfolio consists of stocks in the LQ45 index in the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The data used is daily closing price data from January 15, 2014, to January 1, 2020. The experiment is conducted, including a combination of the number of shares in the portfolio 3, 5, 7, and 42 stocks. Our results show that the portfolio value and the Sharpe Ratio of the DRL portfolio are better than the Equal Weight and Mean-Variance portfolio.

      "In December 2021, the latest COVID-19 variant, Omicron, was confirmed in Indonesia. Unlike the Delta variant, the number of deaths in the Omicron type did not increase significantly and remained constant, even though the cases increased significantly. It is hoped that Indonesia will declare COVID-19 endemic. Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia and the first city where the new COVID-19 virus emerged. Therefore, we are trying to model COVID-19 cases in Jakarta and predict future cases to see if endemic conditions are identified. We applied Neural Network Auto-Regressive (NNAR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) methods. It is found that the NNAR forecast better for positive confirmed cases with an R-squared 0.939 and the LSTM forecast better for cases of death with an R-squared 0.9337. The forecasting results for the next 7 days reveal that positive confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Jakarta will increase slightly. In addition, the death cases experienced a very small increase, only one new case. According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that COVID-19 in Jakarta will enter an endemic phase in Jakarta, with no substantial increase in cases and a low mortality rate.

Many problems occurred due to difficulties in dividing the vaccination recipient areas. This is due to the large number of regions with different conditions for each region. One of the efforts to assist the process of processing large vaccination data is data mining techniques and using the clustering method with the K-medoids algorithm. In this study, data on COVID-19 vaccination was grouped in the East Jakarta area using the K-medoids algorithm clustering method. The calculation is carried out using the Euclidean Distance equation and the value of S > 0. The grouped area categories are at the kelurahan level which will then be divided into several clusters. The clustering process was carried out with RapidMiner on 267 kelurahan data on four main attributes, namely the number of targets, the number of vaccine doses 1, the number of vaccine doses 2, and the number of vaccine doses 3.

Therefore, it is required to have a method to estimate WS at hub height without the need to use measuring masts. This paper examines using the Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (RELM) to extrapolate WS at higher altitudes based on measurements at lower heights. The RELM uses measured WS at heights 10-40 m to estimate WS at 50 m. The estimation results of 50 m are further used along with the measured WS at 10-40 to estimate WS at 60 m. This procedure continues until the estimation of 180 m. The RELM's performance is compared with the regression tree (RegTree) method and the standard 1/7 Power Law. The proposed algorithm provides an economical method to find wind speed at hub height and, consequently, the potential wind energy that can be generated from turbines installed at hub height based on measurements taken at much lower heights. Moreover, these methods' extrapolated values are compared with the actual measured values using the LiDAR system.

The improvement is conducted by simplifying the basic form of KMA. Like KMA, it consists of three types of Komodo: big male, female, and small male. Male Komodo focuses on intensification. On the other side, females conduct diversification or intensification based on the search space radius. It eliminates sorting mechanism at the beginning of the iteration. Rather than determined from the quality (fitness score), the distribution of the types of Komodo is conducted stochastically at the beginning of every iteration. This proposed algorithm is then tested by using ten functions. Five functions are unimodal, while the five others are multimodal. The proposed algorithm is also compared with several well-known algorithms: football game-based optimization, hide objects game optimization, cloud-theory-based simulated annealing, harmony search, and KMA.

      "Cardiovascular disorders, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and congestive heart failure (CHF), are the significant causes of mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders is heavily reliant on ECG signals. Therefore, extracting significant features from ECG signals is the most challenging aspect of representing each condition of ECG signal. Earlier studies have claimed that the Hjorth descriptor is assigned as a simple feature extraction algorithm capable of class separation among AF, CHF, and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) conditions. However, due to noise interference, certain features do not represent the characteristics of the ECG signals. This study addressed this critical gap by applying the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose the ECG signals into sub-bands and extracting Hjorth descriptor features and entropy-based features in the DWT domain. Therefore, the calculation of Hjorth descriptor and entropy-based features performed on each sub-band will produce more detailed information of ECG signals. The optimization of various classifier algorithms, including k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and radial basis function network (RBFN), was investigated to provide the best system performance. This study obtained an accuracy of 100% for the k-NN, SVM, RF, and ANN classifiers, respectively, and 97% for the RBFN classifier. The results demonstrated that the optimization of the classifier algorithm could improve the classification accuracy of AF, CHF, and NSR conditions, compared to earlier studies.

      "Cardiovascular disorders, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and congestive heart failure (CHF), are the significant causes of mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders is heavily reliant on ECG signals. Therefore, extracting significant features from ECG signals is the most challenging aspect of representing each condition of ECG signal. Earlier studies have claimed that the Hjorth descriptor is assigned as a simple feature extraction algorithm capable of class separation among AF, CHF, and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) conditions. However, due to noise interference, certain features do not represent the characteristics of the ECG signals. This study addressed this critical gap by applying the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose the ECG signals into sub-bands and extracting Hjorth descriptor features and entropy-based features in the DWT domain.

      "The liberalization trend has led to electric restructuring in market industries. At the start of the 1990s, it was recommended to shift the electricity business from a monopoly to a competitive system. The electric power problem becomes more complex from competition because competitors must be ready to win or lose. The method that has succeeded in determining energy prices in competition is the locational marginal price method implemented by the New York Service Operator. In general, the characteristic of the supplier offers are in step function forms, so optimizing prices and allocating transmission losses are a problem. This paper proposes a method for determining electrical energy prices on the consumer side in each location. The method uses a quadratic approach to perform direct method optimization. The transmission losses are calculated through the B-loss matrix approach, and then allocations of the transmission losses are separated with the proportional method. Simulation results for three locations with six suppliers, as well as on a larger scale (118 buses, 54 generators) were obtained. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.",

      "In the era of big data and cloud computing, digital records of supermarket sales data and other accompanying factors are ubiquitous. However, less than optimal WeeklySale s can occur due to several factors influencing it. This study proposes particle swarm optimization with gradient boosting regression (PSO-GBR) as a solution for optimizing the association rule in supermarket sales based on a regression model that can predict WeeklySales. As a benchmark for this research, we compare our proposed GBR with two legacy prediction methods: linear regression (LR) and AdaBoost Regression (ABR). The first step is data preparation. Then we develop a model that can predict sales from the dataset using GBR. The next step is to evaluate the model with benchmark methods. Then with an optimum regression method, we optimize sales using PSO. The last step is to show that the method provides optimum WeeklySale s results. The results show that our proposed GBR has a higher R2 score than LR and ABR, namely 0.95 and 0.94 for train data and test data, respectively. Then PSO is proven to optimize sales using the GBR model as a cost function. PSO can increase the ten lowest WeeklySales of the actual dataset from a total of US 45 to a total of US 2, 296.9 by selecting a more optimized Department according to the GBR prediction. This research proves that we can use a regression model with good performance for a cost function in PSO optimization for department sales.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "The National Examination (UN) is a system of evaluation of education standards for elementary and secondary schools conducted nationally and is also used to equalize the quality between education levels. The national examination aims to determine graduation, national education quality mapping, and also for selection to higher education levels. Over the years the UN has become a benchmark for the standardization of education in Indonesia, meaning that the UN is very much needed to find out the size of the quality of student education and the quality of teaching of a school. The government\u2019s policy regarding the plan to remove the UN system has received public attention. The removal of the UN is planned to be replaced with a competency assessment and character survey. In order to know the public\u2019s sentiments regarding this policy, research needs to be done, one of which is to analyze public sentiment through social media Twitter. In text mining tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis, careful selection of a term weighting scheme (TWS) can have a significant impact on effectiveness. We tested the effectiveness of six classification algorithms by varying the TWS in the dataset obtained from Twitter. The experimental results showed that overall TF-IGM outperformed TF-IDF on four classification algorithms.

When the trend of Covid-19 cases decreased, onsite learning began to be trialed by implementing strict health protocols. One of the important parameters for the first screening is body temperature because 99% of Covid-19 patients have fever. Therefore, a student temperature measurement mechanism is needed before entering the school area. A number of temperature detectors should be located to prevent queues. A distributed real-time monitoring system as well as data records are required for daily evaluations. Therefore, in this study, a distributed system for measuring body temperature was designed and implemented with data recording. This system runs online real-time on an internet network client server application. This system consists of four temperature detectors connected to a mini-computer as data control and an access point to a dedicated network. All sensor nodes can send data simultaneously. A web server application is provided for data storage and access to the client. From testing the proposed system, it is known that the system can send real-time data with a delay of <150\u00a0ms on several measurements and other measurements >150\u00a0ms because it really depends on the quality of internet service. The application can run an alarm function if it finds a temperature exceeding the threshold. This system has been implemented in one of a private school in the city of Bandung.

      "Taekwondo is one of the most popular martial arts in Indonesia. The number of competitions held at various regional levels proves that taekwondo is popular. In an online match, judges assess movement through video so that errors can occur in judging the type of kick. No research discusses the classification of kick types. However, several related studies examine monitoring human movement using SVM and KNN algorithms. This experiment aims to determine the performance of the SVM and KNN algorithms in classifying taekwondo foot kicks. The experiment results show that the SVM and KNN algorithms effectively classify taekwondo foot kick types. Using the kurtosis feature, the SVM algorithm obtained an accuracy rate 91.6%.

      "Lysine glutarylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) that plays a regulatory role in various physiological and biological processes. Identifying glutarylated peptides using proteomic techniques is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, developing computational models and predictors can prove useful for rapid identification of glutarylation. In this study, we propose a model called ProtTrans-Glutar to classify a protein sequence into positive or negative glutarylation site by combining traditional sequence-based features with features derived from a pre-trained transformer-based protein model. The features of the model were constructed by combining several feature sets, namely the distribution feature (from composition/transition/distribution encoding), enhanced amino acid composition (EAAC), and features derived from the ProtT5-XL-UniRef50 model. Combined with random under-sampling and XGBoost classification method, our model obtained recall, specificity, and AUC scores of 0.7864, 0.6286, and 0.7075 respectively on an independent test set. The recall and AUC scores were notably higher than those of the previous glutarylation prediction models using the same dataset. This high recall score suggests that our method has the potential to identify new glutarylation sites and facilitate further research on the glutarylation process.

This communication reduce the workload of the base station and increase network capacity. But the resources used simultaneously by the D2D pair and CUE in the underlying communication systems cause interference. To overcome this problem, power allocation needs to be done using Deep Neural Network (DNN) to overcome non-convex problems in maximizing sum-rate and energy efficiency. DNN can be considered a universal approach that can determine the best scheme in the system because it adapt to different environments and can replace the iterative method such as Convex Approximation (CA) based algorithm.

Simulation results show that an increment of CUEs increase sum-rate and energy efficiency.

We also show that between the number of user 11 and 15, the throughput increased up to 20%, while the Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) decreased for 15 users. In addition, 6-degree distribution is used for optimal performance in 15 users.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

      "Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. One of the main risk factors for lung cancer is smoking, which causes more than 90% of lung cancer cases. There are two types of lung cancer, i.e., Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), which the latter is the most common. One method that can be used to detect cancer is the implementation of machine learning on gene expression data. Machine learning is one approach that promises good performance in classifying gene expression data. This study aimed to predict the existence of NSCLC based on gene expression, whether including NSCLC or normal. We used three data sets, i.e., GSE10072, GSE19804, and GSE19188, which relate to the cases of NSCLC in smokers and nonsmokers. The prediction was carried out using six Ensemble Methods, i.e., Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Extra Tree, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Categorical Boosting. Feature selection was carried out by calculating the correlation between feature and target according to statistical parameters, i.e., ANOVA, Mutual Information (MI), and a combination of ANOVA and MI.

This rigless operation for slot re-entry and side-track preparation includes permanent plugging, tubing cut, tubing retrieval, casing retrieval, casing scrapper run and cement plug. The design goes through the engineering calculation of axial load capacity of conductor pipe to support HWU operation, potential barite sagging due to solid content of oil based mud (OBM) in the annulus and the estimated free casing. Moreover, detailed planning is also crucial to improve the optimization with the utilization of wireline on smaller marine vessel such as landing craft tanks (LCT) or self-propelled boat and execute the slickline as well as electricline steps in the temporary abandonment sequence before big marine vessel with HWU comes. As a result, the campaign managed to prepare four (4) wells in Tambora field of Mahakam swamp area for slot re-entry and sidetrack in seven (7) weeks which included 9-5/8\"casing retrieval in one (1) well. The direct cost optimization was up to 75% from the utilization of well intervention units instead of swamp rig in the process. In addition, this operation allowed to troubleshoot and identify possible operational problems including integrity issue prior to the drilling operation such as wellbore clean out, casing free point identification, cement and annulus integrity. Optimization is mandatory in matured field and drilling operation provides direct impact to the optimization. In addition, operation in swamp area is uniquely novel where it provides different kind of challenges in terms of engineering and operation particularly in rigless operation.

FMCW radar emits electromagnetic waves towards the chest of several targets and picks up the reflected waves. Then, using signal processing of these reflected waves, each target\u2019s heartbeat rate and breathing rate can be obtained. Our experiment managed to perform concurrent detection for four targets. The experimental results are between 52 and 82 beats per minute for the heartbeat rates and between 10 and 35 breaths per minute for the breathing rates of four targets.

      "In 5G Network, Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) plays a substantial role in escalating network performance efficiency. Nevertheless, this C-RAN concept's main challenge lies in the need for a fronthaul network to handle high capacity and low delay. The Radio over Fiber (RoF) has been a solution to satisfy the high capacity and high-speed transmission required by the 5G fronthaul network. Keeping the attenuation effect low to achieve the minimum BER by using the optical amplifier is necessary. This paper investigates RoF by considering amplifier placement and different bitrate with 16-QAM modulation for Indonesia's 5G Fronthaul Network Implementation. Optical amplifier placement scenarios are pre-amplifier and booster amplifier. The results show that the booster amplifier scheme can cover a maximum fronthaul transmission distance of 20 km. As a comparison, the pre-amplifier scheme can reach a transmission distance of up to 15 km. Moreover, increasing the bitrate from 1 Gbps to 2.5 Gbps causes the BER value to increase. This result shows that different optical amplifiers and the increase in bit rate will affect the obtained BER values and limit the transmission distance that the fronthaul network can achieve.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "TiO2 is a photocatalyst material with low adsorption ability, while activated carbon is a sorbent material with high adsorption capacity. The combination of the two materials, producing TiO2-Activated Carbon (TiO2-AC), is expected to increase the photocatalytic activity of the material. In this research, TiO2-AC composite has been successfully synthesized using the hydrothermal method by varying the activated carbon particles size (60 mesh, 150 mesh, and 200 mesh). In this synthesis process, TTIP has been used as a precursor. The photocatalytic ability of the synthesized material was carried out in the photodegradation experiment of Cr (VI) compounds under UV irradiation. Based on the photodegradation test, it was found that the TiO2-AC (200) composite had the highest photocatalytic activity, successfully degrading 46.75% Cr (VI) for 12 hours. Based on the SEM image of the material, it was found that the TiO2 particles had attached to the surface of the activated carbon. This result is also supported by EDS data which shows the presence of Ti element on the material's surface. FTIR analysis of the material shows a shift in the prominent absorption peak of the TiO2 material towards a higher wavenumber. This is possible because of the intermolecular bonds between TiO2 and activated carbon in the synthesized material. From the XRD data analysis, it was found that the TiO2 formed in the TiO2-AC composite was TiO2 anatase.  \u00a9 2022 Author(s).",

The YouTube and Vimeo APIs are used to retrieve videos about the disease being searched for. We use content-based filtering for the recommendation process. Keyword-based vector space does some tasks: 1) converts the title and description of a video into a vector space, 2) calculates the cross product of the term frequency, 3) determines the proximity of the title using cosine similarity. The test results show that the average performance is 92.67% according to the purpose of the recommendation system made, namely novelty and relevance.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

      "LoRa or Long Range with LoRaWAN technology is a protocol for low-power wireless networks. The absence of an encryption process on the data payload becomes a challenge for the LoRaWAN network. When the process of sending messages is running inter devices, sniffing might occur, thereby reducing the confidentiality aspect of the data communication process. This paper optimized the digital signature method to secure messages sent by LoRaWAN network devices, along with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and Ed25519 algorithm. AES was used for message encryption, while Ed25519 was used for signature purposes. The aim of applying digital signatures in this paper was to verify that the payload data sent was original and not changed during the transmission process and to ensure data confidentiality. The addition of security mechanisms to the LoRaWAN network, such as the process of encryption, decryption, and verification results, has caused some overheads. The overhead caused by the usage of a digital signature is also analyzed to ensure that the digital signature is feasible to be implemented in LoRa devices. Based on the experimental results, it was found that there was an increase in the size of memory usage and some additional processing delay during the deployment of digital signatures for LoRa devices. The overall overhead caused by implementing digital signatures on the LoRa devices was relatively low, making it possible to implement it on the LoRa network widely. \u00a9 2022 J.J.

BULOG has three pillars of food security in carrying out its duties. The three components are availability, accessibility, and stability. Various risks can interfere with rice distribution in distribution and procurement activities. This study discusses the risks and risk mitigation in distributing and procuring rice.

The results of this study obtained sources of risk from the risk distribution and procurement of rice. Selected risk sources for each food security attribute are given mitigation alternatives and priority values. In distribution activities, there are four mitigation alternatives for the availability and accessibility attributes, and for the stability attribute, there are three mitigation alternatives.

      "Disability is a disruption or limitation of a person's body functions in carrying out daily activities. A person with physical disabilities needs an assistive device such as a wheelchair. The latest wheelchair development is the smart wheelchair. Smart wheelchairs require a control system to detect obstacles quickly. This aims to provide safety, especially for users. One of the obstacles that are quite dangerous is descending stairs. Therefore the researchers propose a descending stairs detection system for smart wheelchairs. The proposed method in this study is the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) as the feature extraction algorithm, learning vector quantization (LVQ) as the classification algorithm, and sequential forward selection (SFS) for feature selection. Based on the simulation result, the SFS feature selection gets two selected GLCM features. The best accuracy is 94.5% with the selected features, namely contrast and dissimilarity. This result has an increase in accuracy when compared to using the GLCM 6 feature method with the LVQ classification that does not use feature selection, where the method gets 92.5% accuracy in off-time testing. Accuracy decreased to 78.21% when detecting floors and 89.06% when detecting descending stairs in real-time system testing. \u00a9 2021",

      "Recently, acquiring the Random Access Memory (RAM) full memory and access data is gaining significant interest in digital forensics. However, a security feature on the Windows operating system - Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) - presents challenges to the acquisition process by causing a system crash known as a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD). The crash is likely to occur when memory acquisition tools are being used. Subsequently, it disrupts the goal of memory acquisition since the system must be restarted, and the RAM content is no longer available. This study analyzes the implications of VSM on memory acquisition tools as well as examines to what extent its impact on the acquisition process. Two memory acquisition tools, namely FTK Imager and Belkasoft RAM Capturer, were used to conduct the acquisition process. Static and dynamic code analyses were performed by using reverse engineering techniques that are disassembler and debugger. The results were compared based on the percentage of unreadable memory between active and inactive VSM. Static analysis showed that there is no difference between all applications\u2019 functions for both active and inactive VSM. Further Bugcheck analysis of the MEMORY.DMP is pointed to the ad_driver.sys module in FTK Imager that causes the system to crash. The percentage of unreadable memory while running on active VSM and inactive VSM for Belkasoft is about 0.6% and 0.0021%, respectively. These results are significant as a reference to digital investigators as consistent with the importance of RAM dump in live forensics. \u00a9 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

      "The Microstrip textile antenna is a form of wireless communication for human monitoring purpose that can be integrated with clothing while maintaining user comfort. However, microstrip antennas have several disadvantages such as low gain and efficiency, narrow bandwidth and surface waves that can damage the radiation pattern. The use of textile antennas also allows a mutual coupling effect between the body and the antenna that can change the resonance frequency, reduce antenna performance, and radiation hazard to the body. Based on these problems, an Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) structure is used with a unit cell in the shape of a Mushroom-like EBG and a via in the middle of the EBG. The use of the EBG structure can increase efficiency, reduce the effect of mutual coupling, create a better radiation pattern, and reduce radiation hazard to the body. Tests were carried out on antennas with and without EBG structures in the bandwidth range of 10-100 MHz for the 5G Band operating frequency of 3.5 GHz (n78 3500 MHz). In the 0 mm SAR test, the conventional antenna SAR is 2.4264 W/Kg, and the modified EBG antenna SAR is 1.082 W/Kg, there is a 55% reduction in SAR when the EBG structure is added. Thus, it is proven that the addition of EBG with modifications in this study can produce a minimum SAR value..In addition, there is an increase in bandwidth of 92% with the Conventional Antenna bandwidth of 27.30 MHz and the Modified EBG Antenna bandwidth and 52.50 MHz DGS with the test object on Hand.

An information-based attribute selection and multiple classifiers are proposed involving Bayesian classifiers, functions classifiers, lazy classifiers, and tree classifiers with multi-test options to compare the recognition performance. The classification performances are evaluated by the measures of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, the Receiver Operating Characteristics area, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient, Root Mean Squared Error, and time to build a model. The results show that the highest average accuracy of the test option is given by 80%-split, 10-fold Cross-validation, 90%-split, and 5-fold Cross-validation, respectively.

      "Humans are motivated to improve agricultural yields by implementing new technologies due to the world's growing population. Precision agriculture, which is expected to raise crops considerably, could be achieved via the Internet of Things (IoT). However, a significant investment in IoT systems for agriculture and farmers who are not computer aware make the large-scale implementation of IoT systems in agriculture problematic. As a result, it is advocated that the focus on the deployment of agriculture IoT systems be widened to include the entire life cycle of agriproducts. While adopting agricultural IoT systems, energy factor must be in consideration. Farmers' interest in IoT technologies will rise significantly if green IoT systems are used throughout the agri-product life cycle. Regarding IoT-based agricultural network technologies, several aspects, including network architecture and layers, network topologies, and network protocols, have been investigated.

Increasing the number of capacitors to enhance the phase shift range is usually accompanied by an increase in the transmission line section, resulting in a large circuit size. This paper presents an implementation of a mirror configuration on a capacitor-loaded microstrip line to enhance the phase shift range. The loading capacitors are located on both sides of the transmission line section, instead of being located on one side. The experimental results show that when capacitances are varied from 0.2 pF to 0.8 pF, the proposed configuration could produce a wide phase shift range of 139.48o and a compact circuit size of 46.4 mm \u00d7 22.5 mm.

It is essential to investigate to know if Turkey is promoting climate change as could be among the reason why it fails to work in line the agreement to reduce the global warming. The authors adopted quantile regression (QR) to study the linear relationship that exist among the selected variables in order to have a valid conclusion on the stand of the Turkey towards the control of global warming. Our findings are: A negatively significant relationship between the carbon emission and the agriculture in the all the quantiles except the 90% quantile which shows a positive relationship. Also, the ordinary least square (OLS) estimate which acts as a robust check to the quantile findings confirms a negative relationship between the carbon emission and agriculture. A positively significant relationship is established between energy use and carbon emission in all the quantiles. EU (energy use) is statistically significant for the 30, 40, 50, 70, 80 and 90% quantiles. EU is more statistically significant for the 90% quantile than lower quantiles. Again, a mixed (both positive and negative) relationship is established between foreign direct investment and carbon emission in all the quantiles which shows that FDI is impacting the Turkish environment a mixed manner. It shows that the foreign investors still engage in both clean and dirty production in Turkey. This finding gives support to both pollution halo/haven hypothesis (PHH) in Turkey. However, a 1% point increase in GDP per capita increases the carbon emission both in the 10% quantiles and OLS by 2.82 and 2.797% respectively.

However, it does not rule out the possibility of several spoofing attacks. User behavior can be used instead of a password to solve this problem. Given that user behavior is unique, the behavior can be used for the authentication process. One of the authentication processes is to continuously use weblogs, as proposed by Leslie et al. However, the method used by Leslie et al. still has a drawback with the Leslie method. Only the user's role is identified. So, the attacker's identity cannot be known if an attack occurs. A continuous authentication method using weblogs and user attributes such as user id, DateTime, event, category, and products is used to overcome this problem. Using this method, the user's identity can be identified immediately after the role is known. In addition, using the proposed method, the accuracy of user identity authentication obtained is, on average, 95.08%, which means it is greater than the accuracy of user role authentication using the Leslie method, which is 46%..  \u00a9 2022 ACM."

      "Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that addition of virtual objects into the real-world environment. AR technology uses images recognition approaches to recognize objects. The objects can be easily recognized if rich in details, have good contrast, and have no repetitive patterns. A feature-based technique called Natural Feature Tracking (NFT) system can be used to recognize physical objects in markerless AR. The features such as blob, edge, and corner in the object are extracted by the feature detector and descriptor before recognizing process. The extraction feature is the most important thing in the recognition process because it can determine accurate results. ORB detector is a feature extractor were suitable for real-time tracking in AR because it has speed, efficiency, and a high quantity of features detected and extracted. However, before detecting and describing the features, ORB detector uses the Grayscale Image Generation (GIG) process to change color images into grayscale images. We found some features extracted using the GIG process not extracted perfectly. ORB detector is influenced by the intensity of the grayscale pixel to find the candidate corner. The proposed integration of the Colormap technique and ORB detector method can enhance feature extraction for improving features detection in AR. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

      "In 2008, the Lehman Brothers\u2019 bankruptcy, accumulated from the global financial crisis, proved a unique role of the highly interconnected financial entities. Shocks in a bank might trigger loss, induce spillovers, provoke a contagion shock spreading to other entities, trigger the whole banking system to collapse, and ultimately unsettle the worldwide economy. Therefore, evaluating financial stability through a system-wide network approach provides more adequate knowledge than evaluating a bank as an individual. In this approach, individual banks and their transaction activities are modeled into a transaction network, forming a network topology. Financial shocks are generally detected through various macro procedures, such as outstanding external debt and uncontrolled transaction deficits. This study proposes financial shock detection from a macro and micro perspective by exploring the effect of disruption on transaction network structure. We investigate the most changing triadic motif as a crisis predictor from a micro perspective due to the crisis period.

      "In 2008, the Lehman Brothers\u2019 bankruptcy, accumulated from the global financial crisis, proved a unique role of the highly interconnected financial entities. Shocks in a bank might trigger loss, induce spillovers, provoke a contagion shock spreading to other entities, trigger the whole banking system to collapse, and ultimately unsettle the worldwide economy. Therefore, evaluating financial stability through a system-wide network approach provides more adequate knowledge than evaluating a bank as an individual. In this approach, individual banks and their transaction activities are modeled into a transaction network, forming a network topology. Financial shocks are generally detected through various macro procedures, such as outstanding external debt and uncontrolled transaction deficits. This study proposes financial shock detection from a macro and micro perspective by exploring the effect of disruption on transaction network structure. We investigate the most changing triadic motif as a crisis predictor from a micro perspective due to the crisis period. The case study is the transaction network structural shift under the 2008 crisis in Indonesia, where the observations were performed from the pre-crisis to the post-crisis period. We discovered a motif with the significant changes as the underlying financial crisis predictor. This scenario provides support for the financial system\u2019s stability control. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In addition, this study uses the Frequency Domain-Extended (FDE) method to increase the frequency or degree that will be used during the decoding process. This research uses the FDE value of K=1,2,3, with Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) channel models. The value of K is the number of additional frequency or degree values during the decoding process later. Based on the simulation results and research analysis, it shows that using the FDE method on NLOS channels, increases throughput by 61% and decreases PLR by 40%.

Direct measurement of soil water content, such as the gravimetric method on large areas, requires time and cost. The remote sensing technology can potentially be applied for measuring a large area. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been studied to measure soil water content. However, the presence of vegetation can act as an obstacle and significantly influence the detection results. This influence can cause a decrease in the accuracy of the detection results. Therefore, the presence of vegetation needs to be considered in estimating the soil water content. This paper proposes an extraction method for estimating soil water content considering the presence of vegetation. The proposed method is applied for the Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) system employed as a radar system used in soil water content estimation. The theoretical and simulation analysis was conducted to investigate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method overcomes the problem of vegetation in soil water content estimation. The accuracy improvement that obtains is about 4.248%.

The caching function can cope with the increase in big data traffic, such as video, which is predicted to dominate more than 79% of traffic on the network. Caching on NDN offers a solution by sending large content into smaller chunks of content, but there is no specific standard for setting the right chunk size. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth evaluation of chunk size allocation in NDN content stores and collaborate with several caching strategies. The test was carried out at the emulation level using Mininet-NDN. The study's results prove that sending chunk-size content can improve NDN performance compared to full-size content. The first topology shows that the transmission delay decreases when sending content chunks. Then the Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) obtained is higher than sending full-size content.

We apply random forest to classify fake news using the Spark MLlib. Further, we use model evaluation calculation through the level of Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1. The results show that applying the sentiment polarity calculation to our Tweet dataset labels 148 Tweets with positive sentiments, 118 Tweets with negative sentiments, and 99 Tweets with neutral sentiments. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature score of Sentiment equals 0.056 and ranks fifth in the top feature correlation scores list. According to the experimental findings, the random forest model produces Accuracy = 0.787 for both models with sentiment analysis and without sentiment analysis. Which indicates that sentiment analysis provides no significance in the prediction model.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

To analyze the impacts, this research utilizes several metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity, Weighted Method Count, Kan's Defects, Halstead's score, and Maintainability Index. The results showed that all maintainability metric scores improved after refactoring a selected backend codebase by applying the clean architecture principle. The improvements range from 21% to 61% for various maintainability metrics.

      "In this research, we proposed a soft decision de-coding (SDD) using matched filters on the receiving side for Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in visible light communication (VLC). We simulated and analyzed the effect of Matched Filter on the distance between transmitter and receiver in a closed room. The information signal as bits has been modulated using on-off keying Non return to zero (OOK-NRZ) modulation before entering the Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights to be transmitted. The photodiode captured the light and converted it to an electrical signal. We employed SDD to enhance the decoding process from received signals. We consider several parameters to compare performance without a matched filter using a 100 Mbps bit-rate, the number of bits is 1 million bits, and the room size is 3x3x5 m. Also, we evaluated performance using signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) to compare decoding in the receiver. From the extensive simulation, the results show that maximum receiver coverage is 0.1414 m2 for direct decoding. When the matched filter system is added, we found that the coverage area increases to 0.7697 m2. In addition, SDD using matched filter has an improvement of around 43.5% in terms of coverage, so massive sensors are able to serve optimally. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Padang city has an equatorial rain pattern with high convective cloud activity. Extreme rainfall often occurs in this region, which impacts human life in material losses and loss of life. Himarawi-8 satellite observation allows detecting cloud growth causing extreme rain faster than using radar or surface rain observations. This study observed the extreme rain phenomenon in Padang city on September 9, 2020, using the Himawari-8 satellite data. This extreme rain had rainfall intensity above 100\u00a0mm/day, which caused floods and landslides in some areas in the city. Convective clouds that cause extreme rain are detected using brightness temperature data from the IR1 band. Then brightness temperature difference method is used to provide complete information about cloud particle types. Himawari-8 satellite data can show convective clouds with cloud top temperatures experiencing significant changes, with the lowest cloud top temperatures reaching 200\u00a0K. In addition, clouds with strong updrafts and ice particles in these clouds were also obtained. The brightness temperature difference value can provide a clear picture of convective clouds so that observations of clouds that produce extreme rain on September 9, 2020, are well observed.

      "Design/methodology/approach: In the present digital era, technology infrastructure plays an important role in the development of digital literacy in various sectors that can provide various important information on a large scale. Purpose: The use of information and communication technology (ICT) in Indonesia in the last five years has shown a massive development of ICT indicators. The population using the internet also experienced an increase during the period 2016\u2013 2020, as indicated by the increasing percentage of the population accessing the internet in 2016 from around 25.37 percent to 53.73 percent in 2020. This study led to a review of the level of ICT vulnerability in eastern Indonesia through a machine learning-based cluster analysis approach. Implications: Data were collected in this study from Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) through SUSENAS to obtain an overview of the socioeconomic level and SAKERNAS to capture the employment side. This study uses 15 variables based on aspects of business vulnerability covering 174 districts/cities. Practical implications: Cluster analysis using Fuzzy C Means (FCM) was used to obtain a profile of ICT level vulnerability in eastern Indonesia by selecting the best model. The best model is obtained by selecting the validation value such as Silhouette Index, Partition Entropy, Partition Coefficient, and Modified Partition Coefficient. Social implication: For some areas with a very high level of vulnerability, special attention is needed for the central or local government to support the improvement of information technology through careful planning. Socio-economic and occupational aspects have been reflected in this very vulnerable cluster, and the impact of the increase in ICT will provide a positive value for community development. Originality/value: From the modelling results, the best cluster model is two clusters, which are categorized as high vulnerability and low vulnerability.

      "The rapid exchange of information increases the need for information security, particularly for confidential data information. Confidential data can be secured using a steganography technique by inserting the data into a cover media, in this case, the cover media is in the form of video. This video becomes a medium for sending a message in real time, which is known as video streaming. However, video streaming has the potential for packet loss. This paper proposes a fault tolerant scheme in steganographic video streaming by using repetition code for ensuring the reception of hidden information in a noisy channel such as packet drop in video streaming. This idea comes from the simplest error correction that can minimize errors in the transmission process of data information with the aim of finding the best fault-tolerant value for video steganography. The method used in this study during video streaming is repetition code with n = odd and multiples of 3. This study describes the embedding and extraction process using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) method on the YUV color space - Luminance(Y) Chrominance ('U' and 'V'), especially Luminance (Y) channel. The measurement of packet loss effect is done by using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) calculation, in which the higher the PSNR value, the higher the quality of the reconstruction. The use of the DWT method which offers high resolution at low frequencies provides a PSNR value of 131.49 dB with the use of the H.265 codec when the packet drop is at a percentage of 15%, as well as message insertion and repetition in every odd frame (1, 3, 5, 7,...853).  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

      "Three years after the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, we have adapted to the new normal, especially in the education field. Learning with video conferences has become our daily activity, and learning tools have gotten more prominent attention to gain student engagement, especially in emergency remote teaching (ERT). Since the trends of metaverse campaigns by meta, augmented reality (AR) has increased recognition in education contexts. However, very little research about the acceptance of augmented reality in video conferences, especially among university students. This paper aims to measure acceptance of AR in video conferences to motivate and inspire students to gain benefits and get impactful technology in the learning process. The research gathered data from a survey of 170 university students (from 5 majors in the study program and 17 different demographic areas) using unified theory of acceptance of technology 2 (UTAUT2). The result reveals that variables significantly impact acceptance: performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit. The least significant but still positive effects are effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The study will provide helpful information on AR technology in video conferences and help top-level management in the university that provides online/distance learning in the early diffusion stage for metaverse in education. \u00a9 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

To overcome this, students can issue a ticketing to ask for assistance from IT support at Telkom University, namely the Information Technology Services. Therefore, the role of the Information Technology Services in online education is very important, because the service is directly dealing with problems that occur in every student of Telkom University. In this research, the author proposes a prediction system for the quality of service of the Information Technology Services to predict whether the services of the Information Technology Services have been maximized and have greatly helped Telkom University students.

      "Lysine glutarylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) that plays a regulatory role in various physiological and biological processes. Identifying glutarylated peptides using proteomic techniques is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, developing computational models and predictors can prove useful for rapid identification of glutarylation. In this study, we propose a model called ProtTrans-Glutar to classify a protein sequence into positive or negative glutarylation site by combining traditional sequence-based features with features derived from a pre-trained transformer-based protein model. The features of the model were constructed by combining several feature sets, namely the distribution feature (from composition/transition/distribution encoding), enhanced amino acid composition (EAAC), and features derived from the ProtT5-XL-UniRef50 model. Combined with random under-sampling and XGBoost classification method, our model obtained recall, specificity, and AUC scores of 0.7864, 0.6286, and 0.7075 respectively on an independent test set. The recall and AUC scores were notably higher than those of the previous glutarylation prediction models using the same dataset. This high recall score suggests that our method has the potential to identify new glutarylation sites and facilitate further research on the glutarylation process.

      "The Greater Bandung air basin, surrounded by mountains and hills, has a unique topography that could block the horizontal displacement of pollutants. Consequently, air pollution in these areas is affected by the vertical-spread pattern of pollutants. Previous studies identified that PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations in Telkom University Bandung have a similar trend data vertically up to 30 m above the ground. Therefore, this study was conducted to observe and analyze the distribution of pollutants in the vertical direction and broaden the measurement points using drones. A drone was chosen considering the available high building is limited, also to minimalize the spatial differences. The measuring parameters are PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations and meteorological conditions (temperature/T, relative humidity/RH, and pressure/P). Two different times are chosen that are at day time (August 31, 2019) and nighttime (September 30, 2019), at altitudes up to \u223c80m. During measurements, it was indicated that the change of the rotor or the drone's propeller speed affected the airflow. Results show that there are indications of PM2.5 deposition in the morning, which decreases to \u223c20 \u03bcg/m3 after the height of >40 m. The PM2.5 concentrations have been lifting and mixing evenly from the afternoon to the evening, increasing at night to \u223c15 \u03bcg/m3. As for CO2, concentrations level up to \u223c80 m altitude do not have a significant or relatively stable change. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "Learning rate is one of the challenging hyper-parameters during training deep learning model. An optimal model requires proper configuration value of learning rate. Larger learning rate results in rapid changes and makes the model not optimal, whereas smaller learning rate makes the model train slower. Finding a good choice of learning rate can be essential to getting the network to learn at all. In this paper, we proposed to compare the CenterNet model with different backbones and different learning rates. Backbones that we use are ResNet-101 and Deep Layer Aggregation, moreover there are eight experiments in total using different learning rate. CenterNet is a model based on keypoint estimation. In other words, CenterNet tries to find the center point of the object which is then regressed into other object properties such us weight and height of bounding boxes. Furthermore, we focus on detecting aerial images, hence the dataset we use is the VisDrone-2019 dataset. Our result shows that training Deep Layer Aggregation backbone using learning rate of 0.000125 can achieve the highest performances around 18.2 percent. \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

The more significant consequence of these two diseases is to disable one or more human capabilities. One of the stroke disease effects is becoming disabled from hearing. Speech disabilities are the focus of this proposed study in this paper. Since the person diagnosed as a stroke patient requires attending the recovery session or rehabilitation session, the rehabilitation center must prepare and provide a sound module and system to help the patient regain their capability. Rehabilitation is an alternative path to gradually giving routine practice to the patient to improve their capability back. For this purpose, the rehab center requires a quantity of time to provide the patient to attend the training session. The training, however, is conducted in two ways, physically and virtually. For the Malaysia stroke patient, the training for pronouncing the vowel in the Malay language is crucial in getting back the speaking capability.

This paper proposes a fault tolerant scheme in steganographic video streaming by using repetition code for ensuring the reception of hidden information in a noisy channel such as packet drop in video streaming. This idea comes from the simplest error correction that can minimize errors in the transmission process of data information with the aim of finding the best fault-tolerant value for video steganography. The method used in this study during video streaming is repetition code with n = odd and multiples of 3. This study describes the embedding and extraction process using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) method on the YUV color space - Luminance(Y) Chrominance ('U' and 'V'), especially Luminance (Y) channel. The measurement of packet loss effect is done by using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) calculation, in which the higher the PSNR value, the higher the quality of the reconstruction. The use of the DWT method which offers high resolution at low frequencies provides a PSNR value of 131.49 dB with the use of the H.265 codec when the packet drop is at a percentage of 15%, as well as message insertion and repetition in every odd frame (1, 3, 5, 7,...853).  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

      "The policy of limiting community mobilization is implemented to reduce the daily rate of COVID-19. However, a high-accuracy sentiment analysis model can determine public sentiment toward such policies. Our research aims to improve the accuracy of the LSTM model on sentiment analysis of the Jakarta community towards PPKM using Indonesian language Tweets with emoji embedding. The first stage is modeling using the hybrid CNN-LSTM model. It is a combination between CNN and LSTM. The CNN model cites word embedding and emoji embedding features that reflect the dependence on temporary short-term sentiment. At the same time, LSTM builds long-term sentiment relationships between words and emojis. Next, the model evaluation uses Accuracy, Loss, the receiver operating curve (ROC), the precision and recall curve, and the area under curve (AUC) value to see the performance of the designed model. Based on the results of the tests, we conclude that the CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model performs better with the words+emoji dataset. The ROC AUC is 0.966, while the precision-recall curve AUC is 0.957.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Laboratory wastewater contains organic and inorganic compounds that are harmful to the environment when disposed of without prior treatment. Besides the high COD and BOD values, the laboratory wastewater also contains metals such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) which is categorized as dangerous waste material and can pollute the groundwater. Although the quantity of wastewater produced by the laboratory is relatively small, it has a real impact on the environment around the laboratory. However, the wastewater has to be treated properly before being discharged into the environment. The aim of the research was to study the laboratory wastewater treatment by using Fenton\u2019s reagent with coagulation and adsorption pretreatment. In the pretreatment with coagulation, three types of coagulants are used, namely PAC (Poly Aluminum Chloride), ACH (Aluminum Chlorohydrate) and Aluminum Sulfate (AS) with their respective concentrations of 10\u201380 ppm. The highest percentage of average pollutant removal of 58.21% was found when 80 ppm of AS was applied. The pretreatment was continued by adsorption with activated carbon and zeolite adsorbents within 60\u2013120 minutes of mixing time. It was detected that the most optimum adsorbent was activated carbon with average pollutant removal of 50.22% within 1 hour of mixing time. Processing was extended by utilized Fenton\u2019s reagent using a variation of the molar ratio between 1:100 and 1:400. It was obtained that the best molar ratio to degrade the laboratory wastewater is 1:300 with an average removal of pollutant of 43.45%. As a result of laboratory wastewater treatment using combine Fenton\u2019s reagent and coagulation-adsorption pretreatment, an average pollutant removal of 90.81% was obtained.

      "The isolated island grid is part of low inertia grid. Penetration of renewable energy, especially variable renewable energy, like solar energy and wind energy will increase the contribution of renewable energy to energy mixed and so do reduce the carbon emission. However, the integration of wind power plant should meet 2 criteria following (1). Decreasing electricity production cost and (2) Keep grid performance in allowable parameter during any disturbances. In this research, the 2 steps method propose to overcome the constraint in renewable energy development. The 1st method is LCOE, and 2nd method is frequency stability, sequentially. On the case study in grid 3 Nusa, Nusa Penida, the electricity production cost will decrease following decreasing of LCOE. Whilst the grid frequency can keep in the allowable frequency during selected disturbance when 4 MW small scale wind turbine integrate to the grid. Therefore, the combination of the 2 methods, sequentially will produce the optimal sizing for penetration of wind turbine power plant into low inertia grid, like isolated island. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

Problems with the e-tendering system remain centralized, giving local groups complete control over the database and system, increasing the risk of fraud, collusion, and manipulation. To avoid bidder fraud and suspicion, the highly competitive contract selection process must be supported by effective and transparent technology.

      "Objective: The modality to detect ovarian cancer at an early stage is very limited. Early diagnosis determines the prognosis. This study aimed to develop a risk assessment tool for early detection of ovarian cancer using artificial intelligence. To accomplish this, the presence of ten signs and symptoms reported by patients with ovarian cancer was assessed. Methods: This study was carried out as a cohort study of patients diagnosed with suspected ovarian tumors undergoing cytoreduction operation at Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, from December 2019 to September 2020. Compared to ovarian cancer self-assessment through questionnaire, postoperative histopathology in patients with suspected ovarian tumors. The questionnaire proceeded by artificial intelligence is grouped into risk and no risk. Statistical analyses were done using Chi-Square and Exact Fisher Test. Result: In total, 115 patients included in this study. The differences were statistically significant in terms of the six variables (abdominal bloating, nausea/vomiting, decreased of appetite, fullness, menstrual disturbance, and weight loss) ovarian cancer self-assessment compared to postoperative histopathology with a tendency towards benign ovarian tumors (p<0.05), while there was no statistically significant difference in the four variables (abdominal enlargement, abdominal pain, urinating disturbance, and defecation disturbance) (p>0.05). According to the artificial intelligence grouping, fifty-five patients were at risk, and sixty patients were not at risk. The Fifty-five risk patients were related with postoperative histopathology diagnosis (with RR 0.682 and CI 95% 0.519-0.895). Conclusion: Risk assessments based on ovarian cancer self-assessment unfortunately were not comparable to postoperative histopathology as a single predictor. Ten variables in ovarian cancer artificial intelligence self-assessment for early detection needs improvement in adding another variable like tumor marker and ultrasonography assessment. \u00a9 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial 4.0 International License.",

      "For safety and survival at sea and on the shore, wave predictions are essential for marinerelated activities, such as harbor operations, naval navigation, and other coastal and offshore activities. In general, wave height predictions rely heavily on numerical simulations. The computational cost of such a simulation can be very high (and it can be time-consuming), especially when considering a complex coastal area, since these simulations require high-resolution grids. This study utilized a deep learning technique called bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) for wave forecasting to save computing time and to produce accurate predictions. The deep learning method was trained using wave data obtained by a continuous numerical wave simulation using the SWAN wave model over a 20-year period with ECMWF ERA-5 wind data. We utilized highly spatially correlated wind as input for the deep learning method to select the best feature for wave forecasting. We chose an area with a complex geometry as the study case, an area in Indonesia\u2019s Java Sea. We also compared the results of wave prediction using BiLSTM with those of other methods, i.e., LSTM, support vector regression (SVR), and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The forecasting results using the BiLSTM were the best, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 and an RMSE value of 0.06. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

We apply random forest to classify fake news using the Spark MLlib. Further, we use model evaluation calculation through the level of Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1. The results show that applying the sentiment polarity calculation to our Tweet dataset labels 148 Tweets with positive sentiments, 118 Tweets with negative sentiments, and 99 Tweets with neutral sentiments. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature score of Sentiment equals 0.056 and ranks fifth in the top feature correlation scores list. According to the experimental findings, the random forest model produces Accuracy = 0.787 for both models with sentiment analysis and without sentiment analysis. Which indicates that sentiment analysis provides no significance in the prediction model.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "The purpose of this study is to understand how leader humility effectively stimulates follower creativity in the workplace during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) scenario. Relying on social cognitive and social information processing theories, this study investigates how leader humility cultivates follower self-efficacy and follower creativity. Furthermore, it explores an intervening mechanism of follower self-efficacy and examines a moderating role of leader proactive personality. The hypothesized model is empirically tested by collecting the data from 405 employees and 87 managers working in the banking sector of Pakistan. The results indicate that leader humility is positively related to follower self-efficacy and follower creativity, which improve the organization\u2019s innovation climate and an environment for social sustainability. Follower self-efficacy is also significantly related to follower creativity. The mediation analysis shows that follower self-efficacy mediates the relationship between leader humility and follower creativity. Additionally, leader proactive personality moderates the relation between follower self-efficacy and follower creativity. This study highlights the importance of leader humility for creativity and extends the literature by explaining the role of self-efficacy. Furthermore, the findings may assist the policymakers in how a humble leader heightens employee creativity and social sustainability in COVID-19.

In detecting brain abnormality form such as a tumor, from a magnetic resonance scan, expertise and human involvement are required.

Suppose we could somehow use an automatic brain tumor detection technology to identify the presence of a tumor in the brain without requiring human intervention. In that case, it will give us a leg up in the treatment process.

Therefore, before deploying 5G New Radio (NR), it is crucial to prepare the simulations to understand its performance. This can be done by determining the Maximum Allowable Path Loss (MAPL) and obtaining the signal strength level from the Synchronization Signal-Reference Signal Received Power (SS-RSRP) and the signal quality level from the Synchronization Signal-Signal Interference Noise Ratio (SS-SINR) of the mid-band 3.5 GHz frequency.

In the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is used as a reference to create web service descriptions. However, it only supports syntactic interoperability, leading to the incapability of supporting the automated selection process. To overcome this, OAS documents must be enhanced by including semantics to each resource to provide \u201cunderstandable\u201d services. Therefore, this study aims to develop a system capable of transforming resources in OAS documents into RDF-based semantic web services. To begin, a relational database schema based on the OAS structure is created to store all objects in the OAS document. The published open-linked vocabulary was then used to create the ontology, which maps resources and their relationships on the RDF data model. To build RDF-based semantic web services, R2RML was used to generate the relational database model into triple RDF. The proposed system was also tested through prototyping and using a dataset of 106 OAS documents, which were downloaded from APIs.guru between 5\u201310 May 2021. The number of triple RDFs generated per document varied with resource rate. An OAS document generates 36 to 16,505 triple RDF in a dataset.

It is now possible to find service operations, input and output parameters, and service composition requirements utilizing the repository semantic web services using SPARQL.

That is why most studies in VMI implement a single-vendor-single-customer or single-vendor-multi-customer scenario. In certain conditions, this exclusiveness can increase lost sales. Besides, most of them implement a single product scenario. In this work, we develop VMI model for the multi-vendor-customer-product scenario. This model is developed based on the collaborative multi-agent system. The relationship between vendors and customers is many-to-many. This work aims to reduce lost sales and maintain efficiency in the inventory. The continuous review (r, Q) policy is used as the replenishment model.

      "In this study, a bowtie antenna design was developed with the addition of lumped elements, namely resistors and capacitors. This modification technique can increase the working frequency of the bowtie antenna. The initial design used was 30\u00a0mm for wing radius, 90\u00b0 angle for flare angle, 2\u00a0mm for gap distance, 1.6\u00a0mm for substrate thickness. From the simulation results, it was found that there was a significant increase in the resistance value of 33 ohms with a gain of 0.4838 from the previous results. Whereas for the capacitor at a value of 0.01 pF it reached but the result was that the working frequency decreased by 0.1656 from the previous result. The maximum bandwidth obtained is 0.9195\u00a0GHz, for low frequencies at 1.2641\u00a0GHz, for high frequencies at 2.1836\u00a0GHz, for resonating frequencies at 1.7442\u00a0GHz, and minimum return losses at \u201321.423\u00a0dB. The resulting radiation pattern has two directions, right and left (bidirectional) with directivity of 89\u00b0, and the highest gain is at a frequency of 1.5\u00a0GHz. From these results, we can conclude that the bowtie antenna can be used for partial discharge measurement applications. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

      "Toxic comment classification can be a solution to reduce the impact of one of these forms of online harassment, where the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectoring method can do feature extraction on comment text datasets. However, TF-IDF vectoring can result in a curse of dimensionality, which increases the computational cost exponentially. In addition, imbalanced data can also reduce classification performance. This study proposes the PCA-AdaBoost method for toxic comment classification with low dimension and low bias. We use the Jigsaw toxic comment classification dataset from Kaggle and apply AFINN's lexicon for labeling toxic comments. DT and RF are two methods to benchmark the performance of our proposed classification method. The performance test applies several methods such as K-fold cross-validation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under curve (AUC) value, confusion matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The test results show that the application of PCA produces a Dimension Reduction that equals 7.3%, where 275 new features from dimension reduction have a Total Explained Variance of 96.6%. In addition, the results of the cross-validation test show that PCA can provide improved performance and a more robust classification model. Then the proposed PCAAdaBoost has the best Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score compared to benchmark methods, namely, 0.86, 0.89, 0.82, and 0.85 respectively.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

In the experiment, first, the level of wavelet decomposition is studied to analyze the best reconstruction result. Second, the effect of compression rate (CR) is considered. Third, the effect of resolution is investigated. Last, the sparse basis of SA is compared to the existing basis, i.e., curvelet, Daubechies-1 or haar, and Daubechies-8. The superior RGB-BPSA over existing CS is shown by better visual quality with a higher signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) index in the same CR.

The current verification system is also unable to detect the modified printed certificate. The research aims to propose an alternative halal certificate recording and verification system. A smart contract that runs on the Ethereum blockchain is developed and deployed for that purpose. As a result, the average certificate creation cost is US$20.035, and the process requires 5.75 seconds, while verification is free, and the result can be obtained in about one second. Utilizing the blockchain to store and verify the halal certificate increases trust in the product or service since once the data is stored, it cannot be changed and accessible to the public.

      "Radiosonde data, which includes surface wind speed (SWS), temperature, and wind profiles used in this study are data at Soekarno-Hatta airport (Cengkareng) in Jakarta. The data period is January to June 2020 used to evaluate the shear of wind direction, shear of wind speed, and Richardson number as the atmospheric parameters that are significantly noticed in flight. In aviation, the Richardson number is used as a rough measure of air turbulence, which values below unity indicating significant turbulence. The surface wind speed can be evaluated directly from the observation data. In contrast, the shears of wind direction and wind speed are determined by calculating the differences in every meter in a vertical direction (from the surface to 10\u00a0km). The result shows that the minimum and maximum wind speeds are 0 and 20\u00a0ms\u22121, respectively. During this period, there was an event where the surface wind speed exceeded the threshold value of safe surface wind speed for flight (15\u00a0ms\u22121). Moreover, both the shears of wind speed and wind direction are far below the threshold value. Based on the analysis of turbulence using the Richardson number, the percentage of turbulence events is about 53%. This situation occurs under stable conditions characterized by the CAPE < 1000\u00a0J\u00a0kg\u22121(no-convective activity) and unstable conditions (CAPE > 1000\u00a0J\u00a0kg\u22121). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in results related to Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) phase difference and Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation (MJO) amplitude difference. The correlation test shows that there is no correlation between SOI and MJO amplitude to the aviation parameters. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

The proposed tag device is designed to harvest the EM signal from the drone as a source of power, and at the same time to reuse the EM signal for the data transmission. We propose a beam-rotation forward-scattering algorithm for the data transmission, which creates the main beam rotating along the azimuth plane. In the proposed algorithm, data are transmitted from the tag device to the tag reader by mapping each bit of information to varying beam rotation speeds. A unique hardware design of the forward-scatter tag device is proposed in this article, and it has been fabricated and implemented for wireless power transfer (WPT) and data transmission experiments. By experiment, we have verified that power is successfully harvested by the proposed tag device, with the average power conversion efficiency rated at 57%. The proposed tag device is able to transmit the sensor data to the tag readers without the knowledge of the location of the tag readers.

Individual factors for patients and medical students are still understudied, as are the organizational factors of academic healthcare facilities. More individual factors have been found to significantly influence security behavior. Previous studies have been dominated by the security compliance behavior of clinical and non-clinical hospital staff. These research gaps highlight the theoretical implications of this study. This study provides insight for managers of healthcare facilities and governments to consider individual factors in establishing information security policies and programs for improving security behavior. \u00a9 2022 by the authors."

      "Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is one type of heart disease that needs attention. CHF is a condition in which the heart cannot pump blood adequately throughout the body. This disease usually affects patients over the age of 60 years. An EKG can be used to diagnose this condition. However, doctors need to diagnose manually, namely, reading the ECG signal directly. Therefore, this study aims to create a system that can diagnose CHF automatically using the 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) method. This CNN 1D method uses normalization as preprocessing, three hidden layers with 16 output channels, a fully connected layer, and sigmoid activation. The research dataset comes from MIT-BIH and BIDMC. Based on this study, 100% accuracy results were obtained with recall, precision, and 1 F1-Score, respectively, so this study can assist medical staff in identifying CHF conditions and providing appropriate therapy to patients.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

When the product meets the needs of the user, it can be said that the product is of high quality and vice versa, when the user is not satisfied with the product, it can be said that the product is of low quality. Based on the survey, e-recruitment websites still have problems related to complicated user flow, less user-friendly designs and lack of learnability. Currently creating software with quality that can meet user needs is a challenge for the software development team. The researchers propose Design Thinking as a solution to these problems because it can create a solution-oriented analysis that is carried out repeatedly. However, Design Thinking lacks project management techniques. On the other hand, some studies combine the concept of Design Thinking with Scrum to address the shortcomings of Design Thinking. However, the process in Scrum often creates a series of deadlines and iterations that reduce software quality, cost and time due to decreased Development Performance. To prove this, this study will conduct an analysis related to Product Quality and Development Performance from the merger of these concepts.

The VF is proposed as a motion planning method for a Hypersonic Flight Vehicle (HFV) due to its light computation which utilizes the Lyapunov method and simple geometric approach (i.e., line and orbital). The proposed control design is tested using MATLAB, and the simulation is tested using FlightGear. MATLAB is used for system modeling and control design, while FlightGear is used as the simulator. The results show that the VF method can guide the HFV to the desired path. It is shown that HFV velocity affects the designed parameters. The greater velocity will require a smaller value of k. However, the smaller value of k leads to a longer rise time of error value on Y-Axis. It is obtained that the fallowing value of $k10^{\\wedge}(-6)$, $10^{\\wedge}(-5), 10^{\\wedge}(-4)$, and $10^{\\wedge}(-3)$ results in the rise time of error value on Y-axis are 1127 second, 109.4 seconds, 6.8 seconds (oscillate), and- seconds (oscillate), respectively. \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

Furthermore, the utilization of radioactive sources requires intense caution. Subsequently, special treatment is needed in handling radioactive waste after the charger is no longer in use. Therefore, the lifespan of this type of charger must be considered. No recent study was conducted to estimate the lifespan by involving the contamination effect due to deposited particles. Compared to the effect of decreasing radioactive activity, the presence of particle deposition should be more significant in causing the decline in aerosol charger performance. Therefore, this paper purpose a simple model for estimating the lifespan of an aerosol charger based on radioactive sources. The developed model was assumed that when the deposited particles covered the active region, the effective activity of the radioactive source was decreased. The effective activity was determined by utilizing a Monte-Carlo simulation. The results show that particle penetration, particle diameter, and concentration significantly impact the aerosol charger lifespan. High penetration and low concentration are needed to achieve a long lifespan. The aerosol charger used for measuring small particles has a longer lifespan than for measuring large particles. The simulation results obtained that the aerosol charger based on the radioactive source used in this paper has a lifespan of approximately 700 days. \u00a9 2022 Author(s)."

      "Kites stuck in the electricity network often cause blackouts, especially in West Kalimantan. There were 426 power outages triggered by kite wires in 2018, 219 cases in 2019 and 297 cases in 2020. The method to find the location of kites stuck in the electricity network is still not efficient enough and takes a long time. This happens due to manual observation by deploying some officers to do surveillance along the electric grid. Knowing the position of the stuck kite quickly and precisely using a drone will speed up the maintenance time. The drone is combined with a Raspberry Pi, which has been embedded with a deep learning algorithm, namely YOLO, which will detect kites through a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi. The images captured by the camera will be processed using the YOLO object detection method to detect kites. When a kite is detected, the system will directly store the drone's position (latitude and longitude) and altitude in the database. In this research, we have designed a drone that can detect kites at a distance of 10 to 12 meters at speeds of 1.5 m/s, 3.5 m/s and 5 m/s.

      "Kites stuck in the electricity network often cause blackouts, especially in West Kalimantan. There were 426 power outages triggered by kite wires in 2018, 219 cases in 2019 and 297 cases in 2020. The method to find the location of kites stuck in the electricity network is still not efficient enough and takes a long time. This happens due to manual observation by deploying some officers to do surveillance along the electric grid. Knowing the position of the stuck kite quickly and precisely using a drone will speed up the maintenance time. The drone is combined with a Raspberry Pi, which has been embedded with a deep learning algorithm, namely YOLO, which will detect kites through a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi. The images captured by the camera will be processed using the YOLO object detection method to detect kites. When a kite is detected, the system will directly store the drone's position (latitude and longitude) and altitude in the database. In this research, we have designed a drone that can detect kites at a distance of 10 to 12 meters at speeds of 1.5 m/s, 3.5 m/s and 5 m/s.

      "Traditional approaches to recommendation systems involve using collaborative filtering and content-based techniques which make use of the similarities between users and items respectively. Such approaches evolved to encapsulate model-based latent factor (LF) algorithms that use matrix decomposition to ingest a user-item matrix of ratings to generate recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on 3D LF model and tensor decomposition method for devising personalized recommendations driven from additional contextual features. We also present our stacking method for a tensor generation prior to incorporating LF models. We validate our proposed personalized recommender using two real-world datasets. Our experimental results showed that additional contextual features can help to personalize recommendations while maintaining similar or better performance compared to conventional 2D LF methods. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the importance of the quality of the contextual features to be used in 3D LF models. In addition, our experiments show the effective performance of our new stacking method on computation time and accuracy of the proposed recommender. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

      "Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been widely studied for biometric recognition (or subject identification) applications over the past decade. Many techniques have been offered as well, from traditional computing to machine learning techniques. However, most studies evaluate their proposed models by independently separating the datasets between healthy (normal) and unhealthy (abnormal/arrhythmia) heart conditions. Some studies even used the ECG signal datasets from subjects only under healthy heart conditions. We believe that developing an ECG-based biometric system that includes the heart, both under healthy and unhealthy conditions, is highly needed since the users might be in both conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature, which considers the combination of the dataset of ECG signals from subjects under the healthy heart and unhealthy (arrhythmia) conditions in training, validation, and even testing processes. We combined the datasets from MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia databases obtained from Physionet. From the combination of those databases, we obtained a total of 32,628 datasets from 89 subjects which were later modeled using a machine learning technique, i.e., one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CONV1D). This study aims to build a light-weight yet reliable ECG-based biometric system by implementing only two layers of the convolutional neural network into those joined datasets. We evaluated the model's performance with k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) and yielded the accuracy and F1-scores of 99.8% And 99.8% respectively. We also proved that our model is a good fitting (not under/over-fitting) by providing the visualization plot of accuracy and loss. These findings show that our model is robust enough for ECG-based subject identification, which can be implemented for healthy and unhealthy heart conditions. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

      "Epilepsy is one of the world's most common neurological diseases when the morbidity of brain activity occurs. People with epilepsy experience repeated seizures more than once in 24 hours. There are various ways to analyze seizures, one of them is by examining the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recording. Neurologists usually do manual seizure analysis, yet it is time-consuming, tedious, and costive. Thus, an automated system of seizure detection is needed to assist the analysis. In this study, EEG signals of the CHB-MIT dataset are evaluated in digital signal processing using a machine learning approach. The EEG signals are filtered by applying a Butterworth bandpass filter (BPF). The mean channel selection is then applied to simplify the number of channels used in all patients. The channels are selected based on the energy value. Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) is used to decompose the signals into several scales. The features are extracted using two entropy analyses, the Shannon Entropy (ShEN) and Renyi's Entropy (RE). This study used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the feature set. The channel selection process reduced the processed channels into two to five channels. The proposed method achieves the average accuracy of 85.64% and 72.48% obtained by REN and ShEN, respectively.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Many improved versions of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) have been proposed by minimizing total distances of multi k nearest neighbors (multi-voter) in each class instead of the majority voting, such as a local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN) that give a better decision. In this paper, a new KNN variant called multi-voter multi-commission nearest neighbor (MVMCNN) is proposed to examine its benefits in enhancing the LMPNN. As the name suggests, MVMCNN uses some commissions: each calculates the total distance between the given query point (test pattern) and k pseudo nearest neighbors using the LMPNN scheme. The decision class is defined by minimizing those total distances. Hence, the decision in MVMCNN is obtained more locally than LMPNN. Examination based on 10-fold cross-validation shows that the proposed multi-commission scheme can enhance the original (single-commission) LMPNN. Compared with two single-voter models: KNN and Bonferroni Mean Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbors (BM-FKNN), the proposed MVMCNN also gives lower mean error rates as well as higher Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, indicating that the multi-voter model provides a better decision than the single-voter ones. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)",

In Indonesia, diabetes is one of the major causes of death, with more than 10 million people living with diabetes. To date, no drug can cure diabetes. So far, people with diabetes must take responsibility for their daily routine. Drug discovery is needed to find the cure for diabetes. protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is one inhibitor that proved as a promising target for anti-diabetes Mellitus. Drug discovery takes a lot of time and effort, and thus, in silico methods, such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), can be used to accelerate this process. We aim to build a QSAR model of PTP1B inhibitor as anti-diabetes Mellitus using the simulated annealing (SA)-Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. The data were retrieved from the ChEMBL database by selecting the SMILES from each compound. By calculating the SMILES using PaDEL, we got 1443 descriptors for each compound, and by using SA, we decreased the number of descriptors. The best result shows that SA selected 600 descriptors out of 1443 descriptors for each compound. The RBF kernel on SVM has the best value with accuracy, F1 score, and AUC of 94.508%, 95.048%, and 0.943, respectively.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Smart lighting systems utilize advanced data, control, and communication technologies and allow users to control lights in new ways. However, achieving user comfort, which should be the focus of smart lighting research, is challenging. One cause is the passive infrared (PIR) sensor that inaccurately detects human presence to control artificial lighting. We propose a novel classification-integrated moving average (CIMA) model method to solve the problem. The moving average (MA) increases the Pearson correlation (PC) coefficient of motion sensor features to human presence. The classification model is for a smart lighting intelligent control based on these features. Several classification models are proposed and compared, namely, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), n\u00e4ive Bayes (NB), and ensemble voting (EV). We build an Internet of things (IoT) system to collect movement data. It consists of a PIR sensor, a NodeMCU microcontroller, a Raspberry Pi-based platform, a relay, and LED lighting. With a sampling rate of 10 seconds and a collection period of 7 days, the system achieved 56852 data records. In the PC test, movement data from the PIR sensor has a correlation coefficient of 0.36 to attendance, while the MA correlation to attendance can reach 0.56. In an exhaustive search of an optimum classification model, KNN has the best and the most robust performance, with an accuracy of 99.8%. It is more accurate than direct light control decisions based on motion sensors, which are 67.6%. Our proposed method can increase the correlation value of movement features on attendance.

We demonstrate the performance of an EAG with a reduction chamber that consists of a neutralizer. The ion produced by the neutralizer is characterized by measuring its ion properties utilizing an ion counter, a Faraday cup electrometer, and a mini-cyDMA. Both the SMAC and NTCC have balanced bipolar ions with ion concentration ratios of 0.95 and 1.07, respectively. While the diffusivity of the positive ions produced by the NTCC is more significant than that of the SMAC, it is the opposite for negative ions. The EAG system is evaluated by optimizing the EAG orifice diameter and carrier airflow rate. It was found that a maximum singly charged electrosprayed particle could be achieved at an orifice diameter and a carrier airflow rate of 10 mm and 1 L min\u22121, respectively. The performance of charge reduction is determined by a multiply to singly charged ratio. The NTCC neutralizer dramatically reduced the highly charged electrosprayed particle to below 10 elementary charges. In brief, the result shows that the NTCC performs better than the SMAC in reducing multiply charged particles.

The NTCC neutralizer dramatically reduced the highly charged electrosprayed particle to below 10 elementary charges. In brief, the result shows that the NTCC performs better than the SMAC in reducing multiply charged particles.

      "Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is a type of brain disorder caused by dopaminergic neuron loss. People with Parkinson's disease have symptoms such as tremors and stiffness which caused the affected people difficulty to control their movement. The diagnosis of PD is usually based on measures neurologist analyses of medical history, review of the symptoms, neurological and physical examination. Therefore, it requires along procedure to identify Parkinson's disease and considerable risk of misdiagnosis. This study proposes automatic detection of Parkinson\u2019s disease formed on gait analysis of Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) signals. The raw data of VGRF signals obtained from the Physionet database is filtered using a Butterworth high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.8\u00a0Hz. Afterward, the features were used based on the maximum amplitude value, the minimum amplitude value, and the maximum power value of VGRF signals after filtering. K-Nearest Neighbor was performed as a classifier to classify PD and healthy subjects. The total data used are 165 data that consists of 93 PD and 72 healthy subjects. The proposed model was evaluated using 42 test datasets and obtained a 77% AUC score by using the most optimal parameter of K-NN with K = 7 and Chebyshev as a distance matrix. The performance of accuracy and AUC score obtained in classification was acceptable even though only used 3 features as input for the KNN classifier model. In addition, the proposed method simplifies the previous algorithm in detecting Parkinson's disease. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is very important; hence it can provide the proper treatments that can delay the disease progression. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

      "Cloud computing has gained significant use over the last decade due to its several benefits, including cost savings associated with setup, deployments, delivery, physical resource sharing across virtual machines, and availability of on-demand cloud services. However, in addition to usual threats in almost every computing environment, cloud computing has also introduced a set of new threats as consumers share physical resources due to the physical co-location paradigm. Furthermore, since there are a growing number of attacks directed at cloud environments (including dictionary attacks, replay code attacks, denial of service attacks, rootkit attacks, code injection attacks, etc.), customers require additional assurances before adopting cloud services. Moreover, the continuous integration and continuous deployment of the code fragments have made cloud services more prone to security breaches. In this study, the model based on the root of trust for continuous integration and continuous deployment is proposed, instead of only relying on a single sign-on authentication method that typically uses only id and password. The underlying study opted hardware security module by utilizing the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is commonly available as a cryptoprocessor on the motherboards of the personal computers and data center servers. The preliminary proof of concept demonstrated that the TPM features can be utilized through RESTful services to establish the root of trust for continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline and can additionally be integrated as a secure microservice feature in the cloud computing environment. \u00a9 2022 Tech Science Press.

      "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to outline the evolution of research on airport service quality and measurement index of passenger satisfaction to explore opportunities for future research direction. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted involving a total final sample 27 articles published during 2000\u20132020, the source of the database used in this study is Emerald, ScienceDirect, Harzing's Publish or Perish with API Key based on set of inclusion/exclusion criteria for analysis and synthesis to meet the purpose of the paper. Findings: Dimensions of measuring airport service quality are currently based on a process approach. There are eight dimensions of ASQ measurement practiced by the industry, which is different from the five dimensions of service quality measurement generally. There is still a theoretical and empirical gap, so one of the challenges in applying the ASQ measurement dimensions is bridging research with applications in the airport industry. Other findings, research on airport service quality measurement is currently focused on passenger satisfaction. The integration of expectation-disconfirmation theory and service profit chain models can be used in service quality, passenger satisfaction and profitability. Research limitations/implications: This paper seeks to contribute to and analyze limited articles on service quality at airports and identify further research areas. Originality/value: This paper tries to explain the development of research on the dimensions of measuring service quality at airports. The author identifies a gap in airport service quality measurement dimensions used by researchers and the industry. The author believes that this study can provide a comprehensive thought on using airport service quality measurement dimensions for future research. \u00a9 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

In this study, the method applied is Design Thinking to develop SIMAK WEB and SIMAK MOBILE application designs according to the data and input obtained from users. The research stages include Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. The final result is user testing from expert users with ten examiners, each producing a success rate percentage of 100% for SIMAK WEB and a percentage of 90% for SIMAK MOBILE. In addition, the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) assessment from the same expert user plus end-users of 39 respondents and 33 respondents for web and mobile respectively increased 6 UEQ scales, namely Attractiveness, Clarity, Efficiency, Accuracy, Stimulation and lastly especially Novelty which has an increase of 5.286 and 5.264 from the initial value of-0.880. The Novelty scale is the only scale with a negative impression initially and was successfully evaluated in this study with a good score.

      "A Single-band Series Absorptive Common Mode Noise Filter (ACMF) is proposed. The ACMF is embedded in a four-layer printed circuit board (PCB) and consists of three parts: a Reflective Common Mode Noise Filter (RCMF), a matching circuit, and an absorber. The RCMF is designed using mushroom-type resonators. The matching circuit is designed using meander lines to reduce the size of the filter dimensions. The absorber of the Common Mode noise (CM) is a series resistor. The designed operating frequency is 2.45 GHz. The simulation results are as follows: the insertion loss of CM (Scc21) is \u221222.49 dB at the frequency of 2.61 GHz, the return loss of CM (Scc11) is \u221218.62 dB at the frequency of 2.5 GHz, while the integrity of the Differential Mode signals (DM) can be maintained with a very small insertion loss (Sdd21) of \u22121 dB at the frequency range of 0-8 GHz, and the achieved Absorption Efficiency (AE) is 93% at the frequency of 2.54 GHz. The proposed ACMF dimension is 10.3 x4.6 mm. The fractional bandwidth is 19%. The measurement results of the fabricated ACMF do not deviate significantly the simulation results.

      "New Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a virus that causes severe pneumonia and affects many organs of the body. This infection was initially discovered in one of the cities in the Republic of China, Wuhan, in December 2019 and since then has been spread throughout the globe as a global pandemic. To prevent the virus from spreading, positive cases must be identified early and infected persons must be treated as soon as possible. As new instances emerge regularly, many developing countries are experiencing COVID-19 testing kit scarcity because the demand for testing kits has soared. As an alternative, radiological imaging techniques such as X-ray images have been proven to help in COVID-19 diagnosis because images from X-ray provide valuable information about the COVID-19 virus disease. This paper presents a survey of Deep learning-based methods in identifying COVID-19 with X-ray input images, and classifies these images into several categories, namely: no findings, normal, COVID, and pneumonia. Several studies have been included with details about their datasets, methodologies, and findings. A total of thirteen popular datasets and fifteen articles are reviewed in this paper. Research challenges and recommendations for future research directions are also provided as an evaluation of previous research. Search for research articles in well-known digital libraries, namely Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Springer, and ScienceDirect, was carried out to obtain a list of studies relevant to the scope of research. Related articles that have a high impact are considered in the list of studies. Also, in selecting studies related to the research scope, we apply some inclusion and exclusion criteria. The list of studies used in subsequent research is imported to the library. Then, studies that did not match the criteria for inclusion were eliminated. The clinical application of artificial intelligence, i.e., DL in diagnosing COVID-19, is promising, and further research is needed. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches could be used in collaboration through X-ray pictures to identify diseases quickly and accurately, reducing the shortage of testing equipment and their restrictions.

      "Augmented reality (AR) has been applied in maintenance, simulation, remote assistance, and other fields. One of the issues arising from these applications is how objects can be placed in physical environments using an AR system. Object placement consists of two processes: object detection and segmentation. Due to the importance of placement, in this paper, we propose using deep learning to address issues with the placement of objects through detection and segmentation in AR. Deep learning can help complete tasks by providing correct information about environmental changes in real-time situations. The problem is that it is rarely used in AR, which suggests a combination of deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation with wearable AR technology to improve performance on complex tasks. In our work, we propose to address this problem by applying a convolutional neural network to facilitate the detection and segmentation of objects in real environments. To measure AR performance, we examined detection accuracy in environments with different intensities. The results of the experiment demonstrate satisfactory performance, reaching 98% for segmentation and accurate detection. \u00a9 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

To avoid this, an infrastructure that can replicate itself is for mitigating the risk of service downtime. The infrastructure is built using a container orchestration tool called Kubernetes that runs on Digital Ocean and Linode which functions as Cloud Services. This paper discusses the design of a Kubernetes cluster in which there are two Data Centers originating from two different countries. The Data Center can accommodate several Kubernetes nodes where each node accommodates one pod that can run one application through an intermediary service. In addition, nodes are equipped with the auto-scaling feature, i.e., ability to replicate pods and resize computational resources automatically, which can increase the high availability of the infrastructure and mitigate the risk of downtime. As for the experiment, The WebRTC service is observed by adjusting several parameters, which are QoS (delay, jitter, packet loss), CPU and memory usages, and the number of pods. The experimental results show that the number of pods before the existence of HPA was one while after the existence of HPA there were four pods.

This paper studies a simple design of quantum communications based on orbital angular momentum (OAM). We consider two system models for quantum communications based on OAM, i.e., (i) a general structure of a simple OAM-based quantum communication system and (ii) a simple quantum error correction coding scheme for 3-dimensional system or quantum ternary digit (qutrit). We theoretically evaluate the possible construction of OAM-based quantum communications supported by qutrit-based error corrections. We found that OAM-based quantum communications are possibly supported by the derived controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and stabilizers for qutrit bit flip error corrections. The qutrit stabilizers have shown that they can completely correct all qutrit single bit-flip errors. The results are expected to open new development on qudit-based quantum communications and error corrections. \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Quantum communication in a higher dimensional system provides a higher capacity, more secure, and smaller latency compared to that of quantum communications based on 2-dimensional system or qubit. This paper studies a simple design of quantum communications based on orbital angular momentum (OAM). We consider two system models for quantum communications based on OAM, i.e., (i) a general structure of a simple OAM-based quantum communication system and (ii) a simple quantum error correction coding scheme for 3-dimensional system or quantum ternary digit (qutrit). We theoretically evaluate the possible construction of OAM-based quantum communications supported by qutrit-based error corrections. We found that OAM-based quantum communications are possibly supported by the derived controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and stabilizers for qutrit bit flip error corrections. The qutrit stabilizers have shown that they can completely correct all qutrit single bit-flip errors. The results are expected to open new development on qudit-based quantum communications and error corrections. \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

Shocks in a bank might trigger loss, induce spillovers, provoke a contagion shock spreading to other entities, trigger the whole banking system to collapse, and ultimately unsettle the worldwide economy. Therefore, evaluating financial stability through a system-wide network approach provides more adequate knowledge than evaluating a bank as an individual. In this approach, individual banks and their transaction activities are modeled into a transaction network, forming a network topology. Financial shocks are generally detected through various macro procedures, such as outstanding external debt and uncontrolled transaction deficits. This study proposes financial shock detection from a macro and micro perspective by exploring the effect of disruption on transaction network structure. We investigate the most changing triadic motif as a crisis predictor from a micro perspective due to the crisis period.

However, drone vision characteristics such as occlusion and small objects are still being explored for performance in terms of accuracy and speed detection. The YOLO architecture is very commonly used for cases requiring high-speed detection. To overcome the limitations of drone vision, in this paper, we explore the size of the YOLOv5s backbone kernel in the shallowest convolutional layer to achieve better performance. The kernel is a filter that has a main role in the feature map, and it defines the size of the convolution matrix, and the resulting features in the shallowest convolutional layer are more representative of the case of object detection and recognition. The techniques can be divided into three major categories: (1) data preprocessing, which involves augmentation and normalization of the data, (2) kernel size exploration in the shallowest convolutional layer of the YOLOv5s, and (3) model implementation in the real environment using the quadcopter.

A self-administered questionnaire including demographic characteristics and a questionnaire based on the construct of the TPB, legal sanctions, and Homel's model were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics were applied to present demographic data and speeding behavior. Structural equation modeling was then used to model speeding intention. Results: The average speed of Indonesian drivers on highways was 90.1 km/h. The demographic data of respondents indicated that speeding behavior differs based on occupation, with non-government employees speeding more than other occupations.

In order to get a faster states convergence response, we define the initial condition of the feedback gains. In addition, the feedback gains are limited to get less oscillation response. The results show the error convergence is improved for the different sets of the sinusoidal reference signal for the MRAC with modified feedback gains. The ball position convergence improvement of MRAC with modified feedback gains for sinusoidal reference with an amplitude of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 are 35.1 %, 36 %, and 52.4 %, respectively. \u00a9 2022 National Research and Innovation Agency."

An experiment was using two modes of interaction (direct interaction and indirect interaction) that utilize different techniques depending on how users interact with a 3D object. Both interaction techniques were applied with three indexes of difficulty and three egocentric target distances (distance from the user to the target). Movement time and throughput were measured for each interaction technique. The results showed that the direct pointing technique is more efficient for interaction with targets close to the user, while the indirect cursor technique may be a viable option for targets further away from the user. The throughput was found to be significantly higher for the direct pointing technique compared to the indirect cursor technique. The results of mean movement time were highly correlated with the targets\u2019 index of difficulty for all interaction techniques, which is supporting evidence that Fitts\u2019 law can be applied to interactions in 3D virtual environments.

      "The rapid exchange of information increases the need for information security, particularly for confidential data information. Confidential data can be secured using a steganography technique by inserting the data into a cover media, in this case, the cover media is in the form of video. This video becomes a medium for sending a message in real time, which is known as video streaming. However, video streaming has the potential for packet loss. This paper proposes a fault tolerant scheme in steganographic video streaming by using repetition code for ensuring the reception of hidden information in a noisy channel such as packet drop in video streaming. This idea comes from the simplest error correction that can minimize errors in the transmission process of data information with the aim of finding the best fault-tolerant value for video steganography. The method used in this study during video streaming is repetition code with n = odd and multiples of 3. This study describes the embedding and extraction process using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) method on the YUV color space - Luminance(Y) Chrominance ('U' and 'V'), especially Luminance (Y) channel. The measurement of packet loss effect is done by using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) calculation, in which the higher the PSNR value, the higher the quality of the reconstruction. The use of the DWT method which offers high resolution at low frequencies provides a PSNR value of 131.49 dB with the use of the H.265 codec when the packet drop is at a percentage of 15%, as well as message insertion and repetition in every odd frame (1, 3, 5, 7,...853).  \u00a9 2022 IEEE."

      "Skin cancer is one of three malignant cancers that are often found in Indonesia and can cause death, apart from cervical cancer and breast cancer. Skin cancer diagnosis done manually by a dermatologist through a biopsy and microscopic process. However, this process takes a long time and has a risk of accidents in the biopsy process. Whereas early diagnosis shows that more than 90% can be cured, while delay in diagnosis shows less than 50% can be cured. For this reason, this research was conducted to design and implement a system that can classify skin cancer in order to facilitate the skin detection process to be faster. This study applied the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method using the Alexnet architecture to classify skin cancers into four categories, namely dermatofibromas, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma. Experiments were carried out using a dataset obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset of 4000 images of skin cancer conditions of dermatofibroma, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma, consisting of 1000 images in each class. The amount of training data used is 2700 skin cancer images. While the number of validation data used is 900 images. Then the remaining 400 images were used as test data. The experimental results using training data and validation data show that the best optimizer is Adam and the use of a learning rate of 0.001 produces an accuracy value of 99% and a loss value of 0.0596 on the applied Alexnet architecture. From the Alexnet model, the test data were successfully detected according to their respective classes with the test data accuracy value of 97.5%, loss value of 0.1272 and the precision, recall and f1-score value around 0.96\u20130.99.

      "Skin cancer is one of three malignant cancers that are often found in Indonesia and can cause death, apart from cervical cancer and breast cancer. Skin cancer diagnosis done manually by a dermatologist through a biopsy and microscopic process. However, this process takes a long time and has a risk of accidents in the biopsy process. Whereas early diagnosis shows that more than 90% can be cured, while delay in diagnosis shows less than 50% can be cured. For this reason, this research was conducted to design and implement a system that can classify skin cancer in order to facilitate the skin detection process to be faster. This study applied the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method using the Alexnet architecture to classify skin cancers into four categories, namely dermatofibromas, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma. Experiments were carried out using a dataset obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset of 4000 images of skin cancer conditions of dermatofibroma, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma, consisting of 1000 images in each class. The amount of training data used is 2700 skin cancer images. While the number of validation data used is 900 images. Then the remaining 400 images were used as test data. The experimental results using training data and validation data show that the best optimizer is Adam and the use of a learning rate of 0.001 produces an accuracy value of 99% and a loss value of 0.0596 on the applied Alexnet architecture. From the Alexnet model, the test data were successfully detected according to their respective classes with the test data accuracy value of 97.5%, loss value of 0.1272 and the precision, recall and f1-score value around 0.96\u20130.99.

      "As one of the statistical-based models, an n-gram syllabification commonly gives a high syllable error rate (SER) for Bahasa Indonesia, one of the low-resource languages, since it fails for a high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate. Two previous models: bigram-syllabification with flipping onsets (BFO) and a combination of bigram with backoff smoothing based on phonological similarity (CBSPS), which use augmentation methods, can reduce the OOV rate. However, there are two problems in both BFO and CBSPS. First, they use an n-gram that is applied syllable-level, instead of grapheme-level, so that they suffer on the sparsity of n-grams. Second, they rely on a procedure to detect the positions of both vowels and diphthongs. Both problems make them not capable of distinguishing diphthongs from derivative words as well as syllabifying named-entities, which have many ambiguities related to vowels and semi-vowels. In this paper, a syllabification based on an n-gram tagger, which is applied on grapheme-level and does not rely on both vowel and diphthong detections, is developed to solve both problems. Besides, three data augmentation methods are exploited to enrich the dataset. The 5-fold cross-validations (5-FCV) using both datasets of 50 k words and 15 k named-entities show that the proposed augmented-syllabification of n-gram tagger (ASnGT) model is significantly better than both BFO and CBSPS. It is also significantly better than the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor in every class (FkNNC)-based model for formal words and named-entities. However, it suffers from derivative words, where it cannot easily distinguish them from both absorption words and terms of foreign languages. Besides, it also undergoes some foreign named-entities. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)",

      "Recurrent neural network (RNN) is suitable for sequential cases because they have feedback in their structure to recognize a dynamic behavior and a sequential pattern in time-series data. However, in a binary classification problem on internet of things (IoT)-based smart lighting control, there are several optional applications of RNNs with different architectures that are applicable to the problem. This paper proposes a comparison of several RNN architectures in a case study of IoT-based smart lighting control. An IoT implementation, including passive infrared (PIR) Sensors, NodeMCU, light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, relays, and Raspberry Pi, produces a dataset of smart lighting control. We implement four types of RNN architectures including stacked long short term memory (LSTM), stacked LSTM-decision tree (LSTM-DT), simple RNN, and RNN-DT. Results show that stacked LSTM and simple RNN produce the best performance out of the four architectures with 95% accuracy. However, simple RNN has a significantly lower delay compared to other methods, with a mean \u00b1standard deviation of (109.8\u00b165.8) ms. We discuss several comparisons of the obtained results with state-of-the-art research.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "This work proposes a new coordinated vaccine scheduling model suitable for the city size COVID-19 vaccination program. It is different from the existing COVID-19 vaccination scheduling mechanism where there is no coordination among endpoint providers. On the other side, the vaccine stock in every provider is limited, so that this mismatch creates many unserved participants. Moreover, studies on the COVID-19 vaccination scheduling problem are hard to find. This work aims to solve this mismatch problem. It is developed by combining the nearest distance and the single course timetabling. It is then optimized by using a cloud theory based-simulated annealing algorithm. The simulation result shows that the proposed model outperforms both the uncoordinated and basic course timetabling models. It can minimize the number of unserved participants, total travel distance, and the number of participants with missed timeslot. It produces zero unserved participants if the total vaccine quantity is at least equal to the total number of participants. The proposed model creates lower total travel distance than the uncoordinated or basic course timetabling adopted model. It is also better than the basic course timetabling model in creating a low number of participants with missed timeslot. \u00a9 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The implementation of SDN is becoming more popular. However, there are critical aspects of the SDN architecture, one of which is that it is vulnerable to DoS attacks that can cause the network to lose the availability principle of the CIA Triangle. There are a number of works have been proposed to overcome this vulnerability, however, the threat is still exist. The proposed technique achieves an accuracy of 88% on SDN-DL Dataset, 98% on NSL-KDD, and 96% on CICIDS2017 with FNR score between 1-2%.

A circuit prototype working at 2.4 GHz frequency is realized and measured for verification. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed coupler can exhibit a reconfigurable phase difference characteristic. By varying capacitances of 0.5 pF to 2.5 pF, a phase difference range of 45\u00b0 from -67.5\u00b0 to -112.5\u00b0 can be achieved.

Many general hospitals do not yet have a sustainable solid medical waste management system in medical waste management. The management process starts from the preparation stage, such as sorting, storing, processing, and reporting, which are still done separated. Separated process can make it difficult to monitor solid medical waste that follows sustainable standards that do not harm the environment. This study will develop a solid medical waste management module based on the Odoo Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system with the QuickStart method. This system can integrate data and information from each division responsible for the waste management process. The system will simplify the preparation process for management, monitoring processing following Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for sustainable waste management, such as whether the waste can be reused, recycled, energy consumed, and indicators for waste processing machines according to sustainable standards and government regulations. In the last stage, waste management can be reported automatically by the system, making it easier to analyze the results of solid medical waste management results and assist in decision-making.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

The analysis of the ERA-Interim reanalysis data and the gridded Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Toward Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE) product from 1980 to 2007 showed that Kelvin waves have a major influence in the formation of the extreme rainfall event over Sumatra, compared to other equatorial waves such as equatorial Rossby (ER), mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG), and eastward inertio gravity (EIG) waves. In particular, Kelvin waves contribute up to +100% (\u221270%) change of extreme rainfall probability during their wet (dry) phase, followed by ER waves that contribute up to + 80% (\u221250%) probability change during their wet (dry) phase. The MRG and EIG waves have much less impact compared to the other waves. An examination of the characteristics of CCEWs reveals that the extreme rainfall modulation is consistent with the regions of active (suppressed) convection and convergence (divergence) induced by the equatorial waves over Sumatra, Indonesia. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

      "Nutritional status is one of the toddlers' health indicators. Parents without knowledge about toddlers' nutritional status might cause negative outcomes for toddlers' nutrition. Toddlers with bad nutrition might have negative effects on their bodies. Hence, it is necessary to observe toddlers' nutritional status, which can be done by using three anthropometric measurements: weight for age (WFA), height for age (HFA), and weight for height (WFH). A data distribution index is needed for the measurement process, but parents cannot have it. Therefore, a personalization system implementation using machine learning classification was needed to provide the measurement to make it convenient to find out toddlers' nutritional status. This research's objective is to classify toddlers' nutritional status based on three anthropometric indexes measurement using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network algorithm. The classification model's performance was tested using different layers and epochs parameters to discover and obtain the highest accuracy. The highest accuracy in the WFA index obtained was 91.58%, with layers used 36 and epochs used 2000 and 2200. The highest accuracy in the HFA index was obtained 92.11%, where 144 layers and 2000 epochs are used. The highest accuracy in the WFH index obtained was 90.00% with 108 layers and 2400 or 2600 epochs. The result shows that the RBF classification is able to classify toddlers' nutritional status with anthropometric indexes with range accuracy from 90% to 92%.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "The global economy, public health, and markets are now being greatly affected by the spread of COVID-19. Indonesia is one of the countries affected. These effects cause fear, panic, and anxiety for many people. When the lockdown was applied, panic buying becomes common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is essential to investigate consumer purchasing behavior during COVID-19 to understand the phenomenon better and provide management insights to policymakers and marketers. This research utilized the scarcity model theory and the Stimuli-Organism-Response (SOR) model. We investigated how creating external stimuli such as scarcity affects perceived value among people in panic situations, which in turn affects impulsive buying behavior. Finally, 320 valid data points were collected using online surveys, and SmartPLS was used for data analysis. Our results show that scarcity significantly increases impulse buying. In addition, our results show that social media use moderates the relationship between scarcity messages and impulsive buying, while perceived value mediates the relationship between scarcity and impulsive buying in Indonesia. The study provides more information about consumers\u2019 impulsive buying, considering the scarcity of health supplement products during pandemics.

      "Interview for competency assessment takes essential roles in Human Resource Management practices. However, the traditional competency interview process needs considerable time and costs and often requires face-to-face meetings that may endanger both interviewers and interviewees during a pandemic. This study aims to present the development of an interview bot for identifying competency based on the Behavioural Event Interview method by using artificial intelligence technology. It is an automation of the interview process to explore a person\u2019s competencies levels based on past behavioural experiences. The development of the interview bot involved two main activities. The first is the data training process to develop learning models to determine competency levels based on provided valid participant\u2019s responses. The second is the testing and evaluation model for assessment to determine competency levels. We found that our method can predict a person's competence levels based on their responses. Our approach can make predictions with acceptable accuracy. The interview bot is a valuable and reliable tool to conduct online interviews and support the assessment centre process, especially with conditions of physical and social distancing constraints. It provides flexibility in terms of time and place for participants, and its process is delivered in Indonesia's Language. The interview bot is more cost efficient than traditional interviews with the same behavioural event interview methods, and it would also be preferable for millennials. \u00a9 2022.

Our research aims to build an autoencoder for denoising text images and evaluate the OCR's performance in converting the denoised image into text.

The next step is to build the optimal autoencoder model for denoising by studying the effect of dataset size and optimizer type. The last step is to test the OCR performance on the denoised text image produced by the optimum autoencoder model. The test results show that datasetsize affects denoising performance and OCR performance.

In this case, the speed of the detection process is the most critical factor to support a fast response by the authorities. Thus, this article proposes a new framework for fire detection based on combining color-motion-shape features with machine learning technology. The characteristics of the fire are not only red but also from their irregular shape and movement that tends to be constant at specific locations. These characteristics are represented by color probabilities in the segmentation stage, color histograms in the classification stage, and image moments in the verification stage. A frame-based evaluation and an intersection over union (IoU) ratio was applied to evaluate the proposed framework. Frame-based evaluation measures the performance in detecting fires. In contrast, the IoU ratio measures the performance in localizing the fires. The experiment found that the proposed framework produced 89.97% and 10.03% in the true-positive rate and the false-negative rate, respectively, using the VisiFire dataset. Meanwhile, the proposed method can obtain an average of 21.70 FPS in processing time. These results proved that the proposed method is fast in the detection process and can maintain performance accuracy. Thus, the proposed method is suitable and reliable for integrating into the early warning system. \u00a9 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

The greenhouse can control the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air resembling the temperature and climate needed by plants to live well. The temperature in the greenhouse can exceed 30\u00b0C when the light intensity is high so that the growth of chrysanthemum plants is inhibited. Technology makes it easy for a horticulturist to cultivate chrysanthemums in a greenhouse. The greenhouse air temperature and humidity are stable and automatic additional lighting uses the NodeMCU ESP32 microcontroller which is integrated with the DHT21 sensor and LDR sensor as well as actuators in the form of fans, water pumps, and LED lights.

It can be seen in the increase in people's consumption patterns from trading through physical stores (offline) to trading through electronic systems, often referred to as e-commerce. Logistics services are distribution actors in the downstream line which are tasked with delivering products from the fulfillment center from e-commerce to the end customer. The uncertainty of the number of requests is the biggest challenge for logistics service players. The growth of e-commerce has also led to an increase in sales volume in e-commerce which has given rise to a new generation of warehouses that are specifically tailored to the special needs of online retailers who directly serve the demands of end-customers in the business-to-consumer (B2C) segment. Traditional warehousing systems cannot handle orders with the characteristics of many transactions but smaller sizes. In addition, warehouses that handle e-commerce are also required to have a fast process in the warehouse because shipments must be made on the same day. In this study, the author aims to perform calculations to find the optimal order picking time in the warehouse, so orders in e-commerce can be processed faster by comparing the picking process time using ordinary Single Picker Routing Problem (SPRP) and combined with the concept of wave picking using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

This study aimed to develop a risk assessment tool for early detection of ovarian cancer using artificial intelligence. To accomplish this, the presence of ten signs and symptoms reported by patients with ovarian cancer was assessed. Methods: This study was carried out as a cohort study of patients diagnosed with suspected ovarian tumors undergoing cytoreduction operation at Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, from December 2019 to September 2020. Compared to ovarian cancer self-assessment through questionnaire, postoperative histopathology in patients with suspected ovarian tumors. The questionnaire proceeded by artificial intelligence is grouped into risk and no risk. Statistical analyses were done using Chi-Square and Exact Fisher Test. Result: In total, 115 patients included in this study. The differences were statistically significant in terms of the six variables (abdominal bloating, nausea/vomiting, decreased of appetite, fullness, menstrual disturbance, and weight loss) ovarian cancer self-assessment compared to postoperative histopathology with a tendency towards benign ovarian tumors (p<0.05), while there was no statistically significant difference in the four variables (abdominal enlargement, abdominal pain, urinating disturbance, and defecation disturbance) (p>0.05). According to the artificial intelligence grouping, fifty-five patients were at risk, and sixty patients were not at risk. The Fifty-five risk patients were related with postoperative histopathology diagnosis (with RR 0.682 and CI 95% 0.519-0.895). Conclusion: Risk assessments based on ovarian cancer self-assessment unfortunately were not comparable to postoperative histopathology as a single predictor.

      "Global traffic data are proliferating, including in Indonesia. The number of internet users in Indonesia reached 205 million in January 2022. This data means that 73.7% of Indonesia's population has used the internet. The median internet speed for mobile phones in Indonesia is 15.82 Mbps, while the median internet connection speed for Wi-Fi in Indonesia is 20.13 Mbps. As predicted by many, real-time traffic such as multimedia streaming dominates more than 79% of traffic on the internet network. This condition will be a severe challenge for the internet network, which is required to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) for user mobility, such as reducing delay, data loss, and network costs. However, IP-based networks are no longer efficient at managing traffic. Named Data Network (NDN) is a promising technology for building an agile communication model that reduces delays through a distributed and adaptive name-based data delivery approach. NDN replaces the 'where' paradigm with the concept of 'what'. User requests are no longer directed to a specific IP address but to specific content. This paradigm causes responses to content requests to be served by a specific server and can also be served by the closest device to the requested data. NDN router has CS to cache the data, significantly reducing delays and improving the internet network's quality of Service (QoS). Motivated by this, in 2019, we began intensive research to achieve a national flagship product, an NDN router with different functions from ordinary IP routers. NDN routers have cache, forwarding, and routing functions that affect data security on name-based networks. Designing scalable NDN routers is a new challenge as NDN requires fast hierarchical name-based lookups, perpackage data field state updates, and large-scale forward tables. We have a research team that has conducted NDN research through simulation, emulation, and testbed approaches using virtual machines to get the best NDN router design before building a prototype. Research results from 2019 show that the performance of NDN-based networks is better than existing IP-based networks. The tests were carried out based on various scenarios on the Indonesian network topology using NDNsimulator, MATLAB, Mininet-NDN, and testbed using virtual machines. Various network performance parameters, such as delay, throughput, packet loss, resource utilization, header overhead, packet transmission, round trip time, and cache hit ratio, showed the best results compared to IP-based networks. In addition, NDN Testbed based on open source is free, and the flexibility of creating topology has also been successfully carried out. This testbed includes all the functions needed to run an NDN network. The resource capacity on the server used for this testbed is sufficient to run a reasonably complex topology. However, bugs are still found on the testbed, and some features still need improvement. The following exploration of the NDN testbed will run with more new strategy algorithms and add Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the NDN function. Using AI in cache and forwarding strategies can make the system more intelligent and precise in making decisions according to network conditions. It will be a step toward developing NDN router products by the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) Indonesia.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

In this study, we try to design the system by using UML diagram and simulate the use of DApps offered by the Vexanium Ecosystem. For example, three basic activities between patients, doctors, and insurance will be simulated in the form of the transaction ledger. This method allows us to speed up the authentication process that previously needed to be performed for a long time with bureaucracy becoming the rule in smart contracts in a matter of minutes. The evaluation of this method will then be compared with eight existing blockchain projects. The result in healthcare processes is cost savings through increased automation, speed, standardization, and efficiency.

To solve these problems, we propose incorporating super\u2010resolution technique, sequential feature pyramid network, and boundary localization. Initially, the ensemble of enhanced super\u2010resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN) was proposed for the preprocessing stage to generate a more detailed contour of the original steel image. Next, in the detector section, the latest state\u2010of-the\u2010art feature pyramid network, known as De\u2010tectoRS, utilized the recursive feature pyramid network technique to extract deeper multi\u2010scale steel features by learning the feedback from the sequential feature pyramid network.

      "Indonesia, as one of many countries committed to implementing climate action frameworks, sees the need to develop solid carbon pricing regulations and expand the scope using its REDD+ (Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus) experience. As a result-based payment for carbon trading, REDD+ can be a beneficial learning lesson for it. Prior to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 26 (COP), Indonesia demonstrated its political resolve to advance its climate policy by issuing a regulation on carbon pricing through Presidential Regulation No. 98/2021. Indonesia's involvement in REDD+ has resulted in strong foundation accomplishments for carbon pricing implementation in terms of institutionalization, technicalities, and socioeconomic outcomes.

      "A novel metaheuristic algorithm is proposed in this paper, namely stochastic komodo algorithm (SKA). This proposed algorithm is an improved version of Komodo mlipir algorithm (KMA), which is inspired by the behaviour of Komodo during foraging and mating. The improvement is conducted by simplifying the basic form of KMA. Like KMA, it consists of three types of Komodo: big male, female, and small male. Male Komodo focuses on intensification. On the other side, females conduct diversification or intensification based on the search space radius. It eliminates sorting mechanism at the beginning of the iteration. Rather than determined from the quality (fitness score), the distribution of the types of Komodo is conducted stochastically at the beginning of every iteration. This proposed algorithm is then tested by using ten functions. Five functions are unimodal, while the five others are multimodal. The proposed algorithm is also compared with several well-known algorithms: football game-based optimization, hide objects game optimization, cloud-theory-based simulated annealing, harmony search, and KMA. The result shows that this proposed algorithm is very competitive compared with these benchmark algorithms in both unimodal and multimodal functions.

      "In this article, we analyzed a Handover Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) algorithm under conditions of 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) single and dual connectivity. A single connectivity enables handover between 5G base stations. Meanwhile, a dual connectivity is a handover occurred from a 4G base station to a 5G base station. In sending data, TCP has a congestion control algorithm that allows TCP to handle any congestion problems on the network. In this article, we analyzed the HMIPv6 performance using TCP YeAH and TCP CUBIC with various user equipment (UE) speeds. It showed that each TCP had a fairly stable delay and throughput under the condition of the single connectivity handover with an average delay of 192.8196 ms and average throughput of 52.8812 Mb/s. Whereas, in the dual connectivity handover condition, each TCP had a fluctuating delay and throughput directly proportional to the increasing UE speed. Therefore, TCP YeAH dominated the stability in dual connectivity with an average delay of 221.4226 ms and average throughput of 44.4004 Mb/s. Overall, this article found that TCP YeAH performed better than TCP CUBIC in both the single connectivity and dual connectivity handovers.  \u00a9 2007-2012 IEEE.",

      "Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) issued Secure Zero Touch Provisioning (SZTP) as a provisioning technique for networking devices without human intervention. SZTP standardizes the provisioning workflow from device enrollment to bootstrapping process. Unfortunately, implementing a single trust model of public key infrastructure scheme in zero-touch device provisioning is vulnerable to impersonation attacks using bogus certificates. This paper proposes a robust protocol for the bootstrapping process of edge devices by integrating the Attack Resilient Public Key Infrastructure (ARPKI) scheme with SZTP. As a transparent and accountable public key infrastructure, ARPKI can prevent the miss-issuance of a certificate. ARPKI offers strong security as certificate management for SZTP. We adopt the security properties of ARPKI to construct an accountable bootstrapping scheme of a zero-touch provisioned edge device against threats, e.g., impersonation, incurred by insiders compromised by adversaries. The edge device and bootstrap server can confidently build mutual authentication using the TLS 1.3 full handshake protocol together with the ARPKI-based certificates built upon a trusted public certificate log, which provides the accountability of the certificate. We analyze our scheme's security properties by performing formal and informal analyses. We show that the combination of ARPKI and SZTP can detect malicious entities and mitigate misbehaving activities.

      "Global traffic data are proliferating, including in Indonesia. The number of internet users in Indonesia reached 205 million in January 2022. This data means that 73.7% of Indonesia's population has used the internet. The median internet speed for mobile phones in Indonesia is 15.82 Mbps, while the median internet connection speed for Wi-Fi in Indonesia is 20.13 Mbps. As predicted by many, real-time traffic such as multimedia streaming dominates more than 79% of traffic on the internet network. This condition will be a severe challenge for the internet network, which is required to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) for user mobility, such as reducing delay, data loss, and network costs. However, IP-based networks are no longer efficient at managing traffic. Named Data Network (NDN) is a promising technology for building an agile communication model that reduces delays through a distributed and adaptive name-based data delivery approach. NDN replaces the 'where' paradigm with the concept of 'what'. User requests are no longer directed to a specific IP address but to specific content. This paradigm causes responses to content requests to be served by a specific server and can also be served by the closest device to the requested data. NDN router has CS to cache the data, significantly reducing delays and improving the internet network's quality of Service (QoS). Motivated by this, in 2019, we began intensive research to achieve a national flagship product, an NDN router with different functions from ordinary IP routers. NDN routers have cache, forwarding, and routing functions that affect data security on name-based networks. Designing scalable NDN routers is a new challenge as NDN requires fast hierarchical name-based lookups, perpackage data field state updates, and large-scale forward tables. We have a research team that has conducted NDN research through simulation, emulation, and testbed approaches using virtual machines to get the best NDN router design before building a prototype. Research results from 2019 show that the performance of NDN-based networks is better than existing IP-based networks. The tests were carried out based on various scenarios on the Indonesian network topology using NDNsimulator, MATLAB, Mininet-NDN, and testbed using virtual machines. Various network performance parameters, such as delay, throughput, packet loss, resource utilization, header overhead, packet transmission, round trip time, and cache hit ratio, showed the best results compared to IP-based networks. In addition, NDN Testbed based on open source is free, and the flexibility of creating topology has also been successfully carried out. This testbed includes all the functions needed to run an NDN network. The resource capacity on the server used for this testbed is sufficient to run a reasonably complex topology. However, bugs are still found on the testbed, and some features still need improvement. The following exploration of the NDN testbed will run with more new strategy algorithms and add Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the NDN function. Using AI in cache and forwarding strategies can make the system more intelligent and precise in making decisions according to network conditions. It will be a step toward developing NDN router products by the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) Indonesia.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

      "Purpose: This paper aims to explore netizen\u2019s opinions on cryptocurrency under the lens of emotion theory and lexicon sentiments analysis via machine learning. Design/methodology/approach: An automated Web-scrapping via RStudio is performed to collect the data of 15,000 tweets on cryptocurrency. Sentiment lexicon analysis is done via machine learning to evaluate the emotion score of the sample. The types of emotion tested are anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust and the two primary sentiments, i.e. negative and positive. Findings: The supervised machine learning discovers a total score of 53,077 sentiments from the sampled 15,000 tweets. This score is from the artificial intelligence evaluation of eight emotions, i.e. anger (2%), anticipation (18%), disgust (1%), fear (3%), joy (15%), sadness (3%), surprise (7%), trust (15%) and the two sentiments, i.e. negative (4%) and positive (33%). The result indicates that the sample primarily contains positive sentiments. This finding is theoretically significant to measure the emotion theory on the sampled tweets that can best explain the social implications of the cryptocurrency phenomenon. Research limitations/implications: This work is limited to evaluate the sampled tweets\u2019 sentiment scores to explain the social implication of cryptocurrency. Practical implications: The finding is necessary to explain the recent phenomenon of cryptocurrency. The positive sentiment may describe the increase in investment in the decentralised finance market. Meanwhile, the anticipation emotion may illustrate the public\u2019s reaction to the bubble prices of cryptocurrencies. Social implications: Previous studies find that the social signals, e.g. word-of-mouth, netizens\u2019 opinions, among others, affect the cryptocurrencies\u2019 movement prices. This paper helps explain the social implications of such dynamic of pricing via sentiment analysis. Originality/value: This study contributes to theoretically explain the implications of the cryptocurrency phenomenon under the emotion theory.

      "Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. Computer vision is one of the technological advances that utilizes deep learning in image processing, object classification, and object detection. In the Object Detection, there have been various models that can detect objects with different characteristics, and with so many models that have been developed, it takes longer to determine which model is suitable for the needs of a project because it requires comparisons between each model. In this study, an analysis was conducted by comparing three models that utilize Deep Learning to detect car and bus objects, namely Faster-RCNN with ResNet50, SSD with MobileNet, and EfficientDet with D0. Each model is run using TensorFlow Object Detection. The models will be trained using a custom dataset containing of 52 images and will be trained in 3000 steps. Based on experiments, it is known that from the comparison of mAP, Faster-RCNN ResNet50 has the highest score of 0.453, and the lowest is EfficientDet D0 with 0.274; for the comparison of Average Recall, Faster-RCNN ResNet50 has the highest score with 0.337, and the lowest is EfficientDet D0 with 0.190, as well as for model size comparison, EfficientDet D0 has the smallest size with 290 MB, and the largest is Faster-RCNN ResNet50 with 1280 MB.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.",

Several Asian governments used an e-tendering system to carry out the tender procedure. By facilitating the procurement process with linked parties, e-tendering attempts to promote productivity, effectiveness, and transparency in the tender process. Problems with the e-tendering system remain centralized, giving local groups complete control over the database and system, increasing the risk of fraud, collusion, and manipulation. To avoid bidder fraud and suspicion, the highly competitive contract selection process must be supported by effective and transparent technology. Blockchain is one of the solutions that enable integrated systems without a third party because it conforms to the decentralized nature of distributed databases, copies of which are held by many users, allowing each system user to adopt transparent and distributed control measures. This study investigates the use of a blockchain prototype for the tendering process using Hyperledger. The prototype's performance was evaluated and tested.

      "The TiO2 based solar cells researches have attracted a lot of attention due to the simple fabrication process and relatively low production cost. However, this type of solar cell has the disadvantage due to its large band gap of 3.1 eV which generates low sun light absorption. To overcome this problem, the TiO2 is usually incorporated with dye or other nanoparticles. In this study, micro-sized graphite was inserted into anatase-TiO2 solar cells using the doctor blade and spin-coating methods. The morphology and the effect of graphite insertion on TiO2 to the absorption spectrum are characterized by using scanning electron microscopy and UV-Vis, respectively. Meanwhile, the efficiency of solar cell is determined from the I-V curve characterization. Generally the I-V curve characteristics is affected by the mass of graphite insertion, Even though the observed highest efficiency is 0.052 %, the graphite insertion is found to increase the light absorption about 75 % when 0.4 gram graphite is inserted to 0.7 gram TiO2 and deposited using doctor blade method. Furthermore, the I-V curve characteristics and efficiency can be modified by depositing the sample using spin coating method which tends to produce higher open circuit voltage and smaller short circuit method. A 350 mV open circuit voltage is observed for 1000 rpm spin coating. A higher efficiency is obtained for smaller rpm. This study shows how graphite insertion affects the light absorption and electrical properties of anatase-TiO2 based solar cell. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).",

Calculation of the Fractional Acidity (FA), Neutralization Factor (NF), and the PMF 5 model were used to trace pollutant sources in urban and suburban areas. The results showed that the concentration of anions and cations for the Cipedes area was higher than at Telkom University and Tanjung Sari. The pH value Telkom Univ has a tendency more acidic than Cipedes and Tanjung Sari because the anion concentration contributing 52% of the total concentrations in Telkom Univ. The results of dry deposition using the passive sampling method showed that the concentrations of NO2and O3were the dominant gas concentrations in Cipedes, Telkom Univ, and Tanjung Sari. Fractional acidity shows that the acidity of rainwater in Cipedes, Telkom Univ, and Tanjung Sari can be neutralizing with the dominant neutralizing components were NH4+, Na+, and Ca2+. From the PMF model, this study found that local emission sources and long-distance emissions can affect the characteristics of acid deposition in urban and suburban areas.
