            "Pulsating heat pipe (PHP) is an implicit technique through a passive two-stage heat transfer system. This paper presents the experimentations on PHP contrived using copper with different inner tube diameters of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm, respectively. The PHP is accused of acetone as a functional liquid with filling proportions varying from 50 to 90% of its volume with an increment of 10%. The effects of filling proportion and tube diameter on the thermal performance of PHP were investigated. The evaporator zone is electrically heated using a mica heater in the range of 20\u201380 W, and the condenser area is kept cool by the water circulation method. The results show that a 2 mm inner tube diameter performs best compared to other tube diameters, with a lower rate of thermal resistance of 0.49 K\/W. Also, the performance of PHP is enhanced at a filling proportion of 60% for all the tube diameters. Further, CFD analysis was carried out for different filling ratios for a 2 mm diameter pipe at a constant heat input of 80 W, and it revealed that test outcomes were in line with CFD results. The deviation between the experimental and numerical studies was 10%. Considering the optimized parameters, i.e., tube diameter and filling ratio, the work was extended by adding SiO2nanoparticles to the base fluid with 1\u20135 % mass concentration. The results showed a lower thermal resistance value of 0.3 W\/K and a higher heat transfer coefficient of 828.64 W\/m2\u00b0K was obtained at 2% mass concentration of SiO2. Also, the proportional rise in heat transfer coefficient at 60 W is 11.46, 17, 14, 4.15, and 1.94% for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% mass concentration of SiO2nanoparticles, respectively. Hence, the PHP operates better at a 2 mm diameter with a 60% filling ratio and 2% mass concentration of SiO2nanoparticles. \u00a9 2024 The Authors"

However, maintaining the temperature is a challenge in the drying process. Because it can influence the drying performance and produce a low-efficiency reduction of water content, in this study, the hybrid drying system is proposed to improve the performance of the forced convection dryer system. The proposed system used a proportional integral and derivative (PID) control system to obtain the optimal temperature. The proposed system was compared with natural drying and forced convection methods. The experimental result showed that the proposed system performed excellently for three performance evaluations. The average temperature was obtained as the highest of the other methods, with 54.68 \u00b0C and 54.55 \u00b0C for coffee and cocoa beans. The water content can be reduced by an average of 27.38% and 42.67% for coffee and cocoa beans. Then, the proposed system also had the highest reduction efficiency of water content than the other methods, with 62.71% and 36.94% reductions for coffee and cocoa beans, respectively.

Digital photos of the feet had been considered to digitize the FPI-6 assessment, unfortunately, the two-dimensional image is inadequate to identify two-palpation based on six criteria of FPI-6.
