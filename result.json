            "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant transformations in various aspects of life. Shifts in consumer behavior, for instance, can exert influence on global economic operations. This situation indirectly boosts the e-commerce sector while expediting the decline of conventional retail. Matahari Department Store is an example of a retail business adapting to this trend. Matahari, a retail company, recently shifted its focus towards online marketing. On one of its social media platforms, Matahari consistently presents engaging content. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily imply that Matahari enjoys a high level of social media engagement. This study aims to evaluate how brand equity influences engagement behavior, with engagement goals acting as a mediator, while considering social media context as a moderating factor. The research employed a quantitative approach with a causal orientation. The target population for this study comprises the followers of the Matahi Department Store Instagram account. The sampling method employed was purposive, indicating that the sample was selected based on specific criteria. Data collection was conducted through the online distribution of questionnaires using Google Forms. The collected data was analyzed through the utilization of SMART PLS 3.0 software employing the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method. As per the research results, brand equity is influenced through engagement intention and exhibits a positive and statistically significant impact on both consumption and donation behavior. Additionally, the connection between intention to be involved and behavior in consumption is affected by media richness. \u00a9 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",

However, whilst there were difficulties from the Covid-19 pandemic, it also resulted in a unique opportunity to implement digital transformation of the education system by bringing about positive change. As a consequence educators and students are required to be able to quickly adapt to changes in the online learning system, and educational institutions must invest and update infrastructure by developing online learning platforms that facilitate the teaching and learning process. Using the lens of Lewin's change model, this study aims to explore the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on educational practices, educator perspectives and key determinants of readiness behavior in universities. This study uses a qualitative method by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who are educators in private universities in Indonesia. This study found that most educators experienced problems during online learning practices, and they realized that these changes in educational practices would continue in the post-Covid era. We also identify two key determinants of behavioural readiness for dealing with change: adaptability and engagement initiative, and innovation in educational practice that helps to understand the digitalization process caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Natural sound levels are strongly correlated with the wind speed at high frequencies (\u22655 kHz). At frequencies above 5 kHz, a characteristic spectral level decrease of 5 dB\/octave was observed. Analysis of the data revealed that, for the same wind speed, the spectral levels are higher when the wind is blowing from a direction where the closest obstructing shore is farther away, i.e. the wind fetch is longer, which results in higher waves. This was especially noticeable in ambient sound recorded in a channel-like basin, where for the 8.5 m\/s steady wind speed, the 5 kHz mean spectral level is 4 dB higher at the longer 152 km wind fetch versus the shorter 2.1 km wind fetch. \u00a9 2024 Authors.",

Design\/methodology\/approach: This is a quantitative method research project conducted through a survey of SMEs in Semarang, Central Java, from February to June 2021. SMEs that have been operated to sustainable business were chosen purposively as samples. Based on the requirement, there are 220 entities used in this study. Data analysis was conducted by using Structural Equation Model. Findings: The results of this study provide empirical support that the factors studied affect the acceptance of SME business actors toward the implementation of SBMI. The application of this SBMI is used to design and implement a sustainable business model for SME businesses. This study has identified, explained and empirically supported the behavioral structures (composites and factors) that influence the adoption of SBMIs that are commonly available for business modeling. Research limitations\/implications: The main limitation of this research is the static view of the structure (construction) that influences the use or application of SBMI by SME actors which often changes over time, experience and failure. Originality\/value: This study supports the execution of sustainable innovation initiatives that have yet to be investigated at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. This is especially true when beginning a firm, because entrepreneurs encounter uncertainty while putting their plans into action at one of three levels: strategic, operational or tactical. \u00a9 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Natural sound levels are strongly correlated with the wind speed at high frequencies (\u22655 kHz). At frequencies above 5 kHz, a characteristic spectral level decrease of 5 dB\/octave was observed. Analysis of the data revealed that, for the same wind speed, the spectral levels are higher when the wind is blowing from a direction where the closest obstructing shore is farther away, i.e. the wind fetch is longer, which results in higher waves. This was especially noticeable in ambient sound recorded in a channel-like basin, where for the 8.5 m\/s steady wind speed, the 5 kHz mean spectral level is 4 dB higher at the longer 152 km wind fetch versus the shorter 2.1 km wind fetch. \u00a9 2024 Authors.",

It must reinvent itself in order to stand out from other sports providers and achieve social and economic sustainability. By definition, a sports organization has to achieve both social and economic goals in addition to athletic ones. This bibliometric analysis uses a thorough search approach and a database of academic papers to investigate the literature on entrepreneurship in football. The most significant writers, journals, and publications in the discipline are among the major themes, trends, and patterns that are found and examined in the literature. The multidisciplinary character of the subject and the geographic dispersion of the study are also examined in the analysis. As a result, this essay examines football from the standpoint of entrepreneurial literature. We used bibliometric analysis to examine entrepreneurial literature, and the results were visually represented. The results show that study on football entrepreneurship is becoming more and more popular, with a lot of focus on issues like innovation, branding, and management techniques. The report emphasizes the need for more investigation into topics like social entrepreneurship and the application of technology to football entrepreneurship. In summary, this bibliometric study offers significant insights into the present status of football-related entrepreneurship research and is a useful tool for academics and industry professionals. Due to the analysis's reliance on the authors' subjective evaluation and a relatively small list of keywords, the study has several initial limitations.

However, whilst there were difficulties from the Covid-19 pandemic, it also resulted in a unique opportunity to implement digital transformation of the education system by bringing about positive change. As a consequence educators and students are required to be able to quickly adapt to changes in the online learning system, and educational institutions must invest and update infrastructure by developing online learning platforms that facilitate the teaching and learning process. Using the lens of Lewin's change model, this study aims to explore the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on educational practices, educator perspectives and key determinants of readiness behavior in universities. This study uses a qualitative method by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who are educators in private universities in Indonesia. This study found that most educators experienced problems during online learning practices, and they realized that these changes in educational practices would continue in the post-Covid era. We also identify two key determinants of behavioural readiness for dealing with change: adaptability and engagement initiative, and innovation in educational practice that helps to understand the digitalization process caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Design\/methodology\/approach: This is a quantitative method research project conducted through a survey of SMEs in Semarang, Central Java, from February to June 2021. SMEs that have been operated to sustainable business were chosen purposively as samples. Based on the requirement, there are 220 entities used in this study. Data analysis was conducted by using Structural Equation Model. Findings: The results of this study provide empirical support that the factors studied affect the acceptance of SME business actors toward the implementation of SBMI. The application of this SBMI is used to design and implement a sustainable business model for SME businesses. This study has identified, explained and empirically supported the behavioral structures (composites and factors) that influence the adoption of SBMIs that are commonly available for business modeling. Research limitations\/implications: The main limitation of this research is the static view of the structure (construction) that influences the use or application of SBMI by SME actors which often changes over time, experience and failure. Originality\/value: This study supports the execution of sustainable innovation initiatives that have yet to be investigated at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. This is especially true when beginning a firm, because entrepreneurs encounter uncertainty while putting their plans into action at one of three levels: strategic, operational or tactical. \u00a9 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

            "In this paper, the vibrations of a string are considered. At one end of the string, a smooth obstacle is placed and the other end of the string is attached to a fixed point. The contact between the string and the obstacle varies in time, and leads to a linear, moving boundary value problem for the string vibrations. By applying a boundary fixing transformation, the problem is transformed from a linear problem with a moving boundary, to a nonlinear problem with fixed boundaries. It is assumed that the vibrations around the stationary position of the string are small. Explicit approximations of the solution are obtained by using a multiple time-scales perturbation method. Depending on the parameters in the problem, it turns out that three different cases for the obstacle boundary condition have to be considered, that is, Dirichlet, or Neumann, or Robin type of boundary conditions. To avoid an infinite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations that occurs in the analysis of the modal interactions of the string vibrations, characteristic coordinates are used together with a multiple time-scales approach to analyze the string dynamics in terms of traveling waves in opposite directions. A comparison between a direct numerical integration of the PDE problem and the results obtained by using the aforementioned perturbation approach shows an excellent agreement in the results. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

By utilizing analytical solutions and laboratory experiments, this study aims to validate the numerical NH-2LR model and investigate the effects of dispersion and non-linearity on the resulting waves. The first validation employs the analytical solution of the linear and fully dispersive model of a landslide moving with constant velocity on a flat bottom. The second validation involves a landslide hump sliding over a constant beach slope. A closer look at the run-up height reveals that this case is non-dispersive. Furthermore, we found that the dispersion effect was evident from the beginning of the wave formation process. Finally, we compare our numerical results to experiments on submarine landslides on sloping beaches. We found that dispersion is essential in the early generation and propagation of waves in off-shore regions.

Traditional methods of assessing tea quality rely on subjective sensory evaluation by expert panels, which can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to biases. In recent years, electronic nose (e-nose) technology has emerged as a promising and objective approach to tea quality assessment. This study investigates the application of e-nose technology for the automated and objective assessment of Gambung green tea quality, especially for noninfused (dry) tea aroma. Using noninfused tea has advantages because it does not require a long preparation procedure such as brewing and does not damage the tea sample, so it can be used repeatedly. However, this also has its challenges due to the less strong tea aroma making it more difficult to identify. Machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) were utilized to evaluate their performance in classification and regression tasks. The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm achieved the highest accuracy and provided reliable confusion matrix results. Moreover, the k-NN algorithm outperformed other approaches in predicting organoleptic scores, with the highest R-squared score and the lowest mean squared error values. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of e-nose technology coupled with optimized machine learning algorithms for the noninfused aroma-based identification of Gambung green tea.

            "This paper will discuss polarization mismatch, the wave\u2019s polarization transmitted by the transmitting antenna changes within the radio channel. When the radio waves reach the receiving antenna, the polarization does not match the antenna\u2019s polarization. It will reduce the received power level and the system\u2019s channel capacity. This study examined the effect of polarization loss on SISO, SIMO, and MISO channels. This aims to determine how much influence it has on system performance, especially receiving power and channel capacity. Based on the results of measurements and simulations, it was found that the mismatch between the polarization of the incident wave and the polarization of the receiving antenna causes a decrease in the system\u2019s receiving power and channel capacity. When a polarization loss occurs, the received power decreases by approximately 25.14 dBm for linear polarization and 12.69 dBm for circular polarization, and it also reduces channel capacity. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

            "In this paper, the vibrations of a string are considered. At one end of the string, a smooth obstacle is placed and the other end of the string is attached to a fixed point. The contact between the string and the obstacle varies in time, and leads to a linear, moving boundary value problem for the string vibrations. By applying a boundary fixing transformation, the problem is transformed from a linear problem with a moving boundary, to a nonlinear problem with fixed boundaries. It is assumed that the vibrations around the stationary position of the string are small. Explicit approximations of the solution are obtained by using a multiple time-scales perturbation method. Depending on the parameters in the problem, it turns out that three different cases for the obstacle boundary condition have to be considered, that is, Dirichlet, or Neumann, or Robin type of boundary conditions. To avoid an infinite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations that occurs in the analysis of the modal interactions of the string vibrations, characteristic coordinates are used together with a multiple time-scales approach to analyze the string dynamics in terms of traveling waves in opposite directions. A comparison between a direct numerical integration of the PDE problem and the results obtained by using the aforementioned perturbation approach shows an excellent agreement in the results. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

            "Education was one of the sectors most significantly affected by the Covid-19 due to social distancing and home study requirements, which resulted in educational institutions changing the learning process in terms of how classes were delivered. However, whilst there were difficulties from the Covid-19 pandemic, it also resulted in a unique opportunity to implement digital transformation of the education system by bringing about positive change. As a consequence educators and students are required to be able to quickly adapt to changes in the online learning system, and educational institutions must invest and update infrastructure by developing online learning platforms that facilitate the teaching and learning process. Using the lens of Lewin's change model, this study aims to explore the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on educational practices, educator perspectives and key determinants of readiness behavior in universities. This study uses a qualitative method by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who are educators in private universities in Indonesia. This study found that most educators experienced problems during online learning practices, and they realized that these changes in educational practices would continue in the post-Covid era. We also identify two key determinants of behavioural readiness for dealing with change: adaptability and engagement initiative, and innovation in educational practice that helps to understand the digitalization process caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This study has both practical and academic implications by providing recommendations for education policy makers, practitioners and researchers on post-Covid education systems and how to deal with future crises. \u00a9 2023",

            "Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of business incubation metrics based on an adaptation of the lean start-up (LS) framework on start-up survival after incubation. This study also analyzes the obstacles in implementing the LS framework as incubation metrics. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study uses mixed methods. Quantitative research using multiple linear regression was applied to the data of 30 start-ups incubated at Bandung Techno Park for the 2014\u20132017 period and survival tracking data after the incubation. A qualitative approach to complete the explanatory work was conducted through in-depth interviews with 12 respondents, including start-up graduates from the incubation program, program managers and mentors. Findings: This study confirms that several LS incubation metrics significantly affect start-up sustainability after incubation. In addition, this study also explains several problems in applying the LS discipline that needs attention to increase incubation success. Research limitations\/implications: Research was conducted only at one technology business incubator (TBI) model that focuses on digital start-ups in the emerging ecosystem. Research results can be biased in different situations and ecosystems. Practical implications: The explanation of the relationship of LS-based incubation metrics to the survival of start-ups, as well as the challenges of their implementation, can be a reference for TBI management to consider and prioritize intervention strategies, thereby improving TBI\u2019s business processes and increasing the success rate of incubated start-ups. Social implications: The creation of university start-ups and spin-offs has become a key performance indicator mandatory for technology universities in Indonesia. The existence of TBI institutions in universities as channels of technology commercialization is essential. The incubator\u2019s success in creating a new technology-based company will have a significant social impact on the surrounding environment. Originality\/value: Although the LS method is popular in start-up communities and among practitioners, it is rarely used in the incubation process at universities. These results can be considered for university TBIs to explore LS as an incubation management tool to increase the success rate of incubated start-ups. \u00a9 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",
