Digital media commonly used today is digital media that is generally owned by Indonesian netizens, namely social media. By only having internet access all netizens can become social media users. Using internet access is not only used by Indonesian people in person, but Indonesian people to interact in an industry \/ company often interact with the use of internet media, considering that the development of the Digital Industry Revolution has entered the Industrial Revolution 4.0. \"Both practitioners and academics agree that the social revolution occurring through digital channels will have a profound impact on hoe people interact with each other and how companies manage their relationships in the changing communications landscape (Greenberg, 2010;Kletzmann et al.,2011;Dennis et al.,2009)\" (Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, Vol. 30).

To achieve this goal, one of the solutions being pushed by the Ministry of Industry is to spur domestic industries to continue to innovate in the face of the implementation of Industry 4.0. Because of that case, human interaction in the industry will not be separated from a communication process, it's just that at this time different is a tool \/ media in carrying out the communication process, which originally used conventional communication media to switch to convergence (digital) communication media.

As OCC suffers from low data transmission rate in comparison with very high-speed modulation of light emitting diodes (LEDs), it imposes major limitations on an optical camera-based vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. This paper presents an OCC-based high-speed V2V using a distinct capturing strategy called selective capture (SC). Experiments were performed to verify the proposed SC-based V2V based on a Raspberry Pi camera module (RaspiCam). The SC was performed with template matching technique on the RaspiCam module. The module enables both the selection of resolution and the capturing of vehicle taillights only from the full camera capture frame. As the transmitter, a 4 \u00d7 4 red LED array was employed as the taillights of a vehicle. It is found that the use of SC to capture the taillights effectively increases the capture speed of RaspiCam from 120 frames per second (fps) to 435 fps, yielding an efficient and high-speed V2V with flicker-free taillights. In addition, the proposed SC-V2V with increased capture speed provides a data rate of up to 3.456 kbps and achieves acceptable bit error rate performance at a distance of up to 175 cm. \u00a9 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

This study aimed to measure arthropod diversity and their relation to abiotic factors in Semedi Show Cave. Arthropods were sampled by hand collecting, a combination of pitfall and bait traps, and Berlese extractor. Abiotic factors measured were climatic and edaphic parameters. Sampling was conducted in the 3 zones of Semedi cave (Entrance, Twilight, and Dark). Data were analyzed by calculation of richness (Margalef), diversity and evenness (Shannon-Wiener) indices, cluster and correlation analyses. A total 1095 individuals of arthropods consisting of 102 morphospecies, belonging to 6 Classes, and 19 Orders were sampled during this study. The entrance zone had higher richness and diversity indices (richness=12.80, diversity=3.40) than the twilight zone (richness=7.85, diversity=3.25) and the dark zone (richness=5.35, diversity=2.63). Meanwhile, the twilight zone had higher evenness index (0.85) than the entrance zone (0.77) and the dark zone (0.77). Each zone of Semedi cave had different abiotic conditions.

However, those tools need a specific file input format before generating a graph and visualizing it. In this research, we tried to do experiment and analysed data transformation from Twitter raw data to a JSON file format that can be used for most of the web-based network visualization tools. Using those techniques, we can decrease the memory usage by 1,526.1 MB and increase graph formation running time by 1,718.75 seconds. Those techniques can also be added with Text Mining modules for online context analysis of network visualization. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."

This paper studies a preliminary model of Indonesia 5G channels based on statistical spatial channel model (SSCM) for operating frequency of 28 GHz. We calculate the estimate channel capacities of Indonesia 5G (per link) from the obtained power delay profile (PDP) to observe the outage probability representing the theoretical performances of 5G in Indonesia. The outage probability is calculated from the probability when the channel capacity C dropped into a value below the channel coding rate R with a probability of P (R \u2265 C) due to the dynamic fading, indicating a failure of detection. The outage probability is in detail analyzed in this paper since it is expected to be used as a reference performance of 5G in Indonesia. We conduct a series of computer simulations to evaluate the performance of Indonesia 5G under the obtained channel model based on cyclic prefix-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) with a channel coding scheme. We found an agreement in terms of diversity of practical and theoretical outage probability confirming a good estimation of the performance of 5G in Indonesia.

            "Objective: Intersection movement assist (IMA) has been recognized as one of the prominent countermeasures to reduce angle crashes at intersections, which constitute 22% of total crashes in the United States. Utilizing vehicle-based sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, IMA offers extended vision to provide early warning for an imminent crash. However, most of IMA-related research implements their methods and strategies only in simulations, test tracks, or driving simulator studies that have quite a few assumptions and limitations and hence the effectiveness evaluations reported may not be transferable or comparable. Methods: This study seeks to develop a generalized evaluation scheme that can be used not only to assess the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety at intersections but to facilitate comparisons across similar studies. The proposed evaluation scheme utilizes the concepts of traffic conflict in terms of time-to-collision (TTC) as a crash surrogate. This approach avoids the issue of having insufficient crash frequency data for system evaluation. To measure the effectiveness of IMA on reducing traffic conflicts, a relative risk is calculated for comparing the risk of with\/without using the IMA. As a proof-of-concept study, this study applied the proposed evaluation scheme and reported the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety in a field operation test (FOT). Seven test scenarios were conducted at 4 intersections, and a total of 40 participants were recruited to use the IMA for 6\u00a0months. Results: It was estimated that IMA users have 26% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 5\u00a0s and have 15% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 4\u00a0s. However, the results vary across different sites and different definitions of conflicts in terms of TTC. Conclusions: Overall, IMA is promising to effectively reduce angle crashes related to sight obstruction and has potential to reduce not only crash frequency but crash severity. \u00a9 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Conclusions: Overall, IMA is promising to effectively reduce angle crashes related to sight obstruction and has potential to reduce not only crash frequency but crash severity. \u00a9 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

            "The government has required public transport provider to equip their fleets with information tools if their fleets get in an accident. Currently, the collection of evidence of motor vehicle accidents by the authorities has not included data on the condition of the vehicle before the occurrence of the accident. Unlike an aircraft accident investigation that includes aircraft condition data derived from various sensors recorded in Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The recording data in FDR can be the evidence of the accident and it is expected to add to the accuracy of an accident investigation. Car Data Recorder Prototype is a system capable of recording the condition of four-wheeled vehicles and notify if there has been an accident. Vehicle condition recording utilizes Onboard Diagnostic-II (OBD-II) feature with parameter recording: gas pedal position, engine speed, vehicle speed, and engine temperature. Accident detection utilizes the ADXL345 accelerometer sensor and the condition of open or non-open airbag vehicles monitored by Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). If there is an indication of an accident, notification in the form of SMS will be sent by using GSM SIM800L module. Testing the data recording feature prototype car data recorder performed on city car is able to take advantage of features OBD-II to record the parameters that have been determined. Recorded data is processed into graphical information showing the position of the gas pedal, engine speed, vehicle speed, and engine temperature within a specified time range. There is a 5-second delay in recording data of engine speed and speed of the vehicle, but the data pattern of recording engine rotation is identical with 84.8% accuracy while the data of vehicle speed recording is also synonymous with 74.4% accuracy. Based on the accident simulation results, the ADXL345 and DTC accelerometer can detect frontal collisions and airbag conditions, which triggers GSM SIM800L to send SMS notification. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The captured signal is further processed and transmitted using a VLC link to control smart home devices. To validate the proposed EOG-VLC based smart device control scheme, experiments were conducted. For the ease of the experiments, instead of an actual smart home device, we employed a digital door lock to verify its accurate control operation. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed smart device control scheme operates accurately and reliably. Therefore, since the proposed scheme is based on a less hazardous VLC link, it is envisioned that the scheme can pave the way for greener and safer smart homes, particularly benefiting disabled and elderly people. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

This paper proposes a system capable of making travel itinerary, for tourists who want to visit an area within a few days. For generating itinerary, the system considers several criterias (Multi-criteria-based), which include the popularity level of tourist attractions to visit, tourist visits that minimize budgets or tourist visits with as many destinations as possible. To handle multi criteria-based itinerary, we use the concept of multi attribute utility theory (MAUT). The running time of multi criteria-based itinerary is not significantly different from time-based itinerary. In addition, the number of tourist attractions in the itinerary is more than time-based itinerary, because the combination of solutions from each ant becomes more diverse. \u00a9 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.",

They are typically created from resonant elements, thus their refraction properties depend strongly on frequency. The resulting chromatic aberration is undesirable for most applications, motivating recent efforts in the development of achromatic metasurfaces. However, it remains unclear whether there are any physical limits on the achievable operating bandwidth of achromatic metasurfaces. Here we address this question, considering a common microwave metasurface geometry based on three metallic layers, separated by dielectric substrates. Since each of these metallic layers is modeled as an impedance, we apply Foster's reactance theorem to determine the bandwidth over which they are physically realizable using passive, causal and lossless structures. We derive limits for the bandwidth and total size of the metasurface, showing that there is a trade-off between these two parameters. A higher angle of refraction, corresponding to a larger numerical aperture for a lens, further limits the realizable bandwidth. We consider both Huygens' and Omega-bianisotropic metasurface types, and show that the limit is more severe for bianisotropic metasurfaces, making them less suitable for broadband achromatic designs. \u00a9 2018 optical society of america under the terms of the osa open access publishing agreement.",

This channel condition constraints come from path loss and the multipath channel fading. With these constraints, the algorithm in the routing protocol and congestion control is confronted with the uncertainty of connection quality and probability of successful packet transmission, respectively. It is important to investigate the reliability and robustness of routing protocol and congestion control algorithms in dealing with such situation. In this paper, we develop a detailed approach and analytical throughput performance with a cross layer scheme (CLS) between routing and congestion control mechanism based on signal to noise ratio (SNR) in Rician and Rayleigh as multipath fading channel. We proposed joint routing and congestion control TCP with a cross layer scheme model based on SNR (RTCP-SNR). We compare the performance of RTCP-SNR with conventional routing-TCP and routing-TCP that used CLS with routing aware (RTCP-RA) model. The analyses and the simulation results showed that RTCP-SNR in a multipath channel outperforms conventional routing-TCP and RTCP-RA.

This study proposed a method for detecting and counting the number of mangos in occluded conditions by evaluating the color filter and identifying the specific characteristics of fruit such as the homogeneity of fruit surface. This study fully made use of the information extracted from the created blobs after conducting histogram filtering such as blob weighting, evaluating the blob gradient topography and performing a hierarchical clustering.

The function of this method was also improved by providing the information of the position and the number of fruits in the result images. This information could be used to make a precise detection.

The design is used for power harvester in a 13.56 MHz smart card tag IC. In order to provide a high-power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and wide range input supply, the bandgap reference circuit is enhanced by a pre-regulator circuit. The pre-regulator circuit is designed using differential amplifier to form a Low-dropout (LDO) regulator with a feedback to BGR core circuit. The pre-regulator circuit mainly improves the stability of output voltage when the input voltage changes. In bandgap core circuit, the reference voltage is obtained by compensating the negative temperature coefficient (CTAT) with a positive temperature coefficient (PTAT). Therefore, the output voltage can be kept stable when the temperature changes. Additionally, the start-up circuit is designed to overcome zero current condition in BGR circuit during the power starts on and this circuit turns off after the whole circuit reaches the desired operating point. This paper provides both the schematic and layout design implemented in 180nm CMOS technology. From the simulation result, the output voltage has a temperature coefficient of -0.26 mV\/\u00b0C with temperature range from -50 \u00b0C to 125 \u00b0C and PSRR of -116 dB at DC with input voltage supply range of 1.8-6 V.

The integrated feature is selected based on Information Gain rank value between static and dynamic features. Then, all datasets are tested on Na\u00efve Bayes and Random Forest classifiers. We extracted 49 features from 700 polymorphic computer virus samples from Netherland Net Lab and VXHeaven, which includes benign and polymorphic virus function. We spilled dataset based on 60% for training and 40% for testing. The performance metric of accuracy value, receiver operating characteristic and mean absolute error are compared between two algorithms in the experiment of static, dynamic and integrated features.

This process is seen to be less systematic and imposes much time on the evaluator, coordinator and supervisor who are also lecturers. Information Management and PSM Evalua-tion System is designed to automate information management and evaluation of PSM to keep the information in the database. The scope of these systems focuses on admin, supervisor, evaluator and coordinator bound to PSM1 and PSM2. Some of the functions that can be operated on the system are evaluation, updating PSM students' information and generating reports. The chosen methodology is an Evolu-tionary Prototype which needs are taken care of the system during modifications. Requirements established during the interview is em-ployed to form a common structure with the essential basic functions of the system. Therefore, Information Management and PSM Eval-uation System was developed to automate the manual system to increase efficiency. The system was developed using ASP.net technolo-gy and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and has been successfully completed within the specified time. \u00a9 2018 Authors."

Moreover, most of Sundanese affixes are derivational, so removing the derivational affix as the first step is reasonable. To handle ambiguity, the last recognized affix was returned as the result. As the baseline, a Confix-Stripping Approach that applies Porter Stemmer for the Indonesian language was used.

            "Nowadays, conventional taxi business meets strong competition with the online taxi service. One of the problem is that in online taxi service that adopts sharing economy platform, public can join to be a driver easily as far as he owns the vehicle. So, there are large number of vehicles are in the online taxi service. This condition is different to the existing conventional taxi that is operated by private company and the vehicles are owned by the taxi company. Even the taxi company is a big corporate, it still cannot compete with the online taxi service. The answer is developing collaboration between taxi companies so that the service is operated by a single system. Unfortunately, creating collaboration system among taxi companies is not easy. It is because the number of fleets that are owned between companies is various. The other problem is that each company has its own pricing strategy. In this research, we propose the dispatch model for conventional taxi collaboration system. Parameters in this model are travel cost, pickup distance, vehicle\u2019s idle time, and the fleet size. In this research, we propose three models. In the first model, order will be allocated to the vehicle that offers the lowest travel cost and has longest idle time. In the second model, order will be allocated to the vehicle that offers the lowest travel cost but the model does not guarantee that longer idle time vehicle will be preferred. In the third model, the order will be allocated to the vehicle that has the highest aggregate score of travel cost, pickup distance, idle time, and fleet size. Based on the simulation result, the first and the second models has advantage in offering the lowest travel cost while the third model has advantage in keeping pickup ratio at maximum level. \u00a9 2005 \u2013 ongoing JATIT & LLS.",

            "Nowadays, conventional taxi business meets strong competition with the online taxi service. One of the problem is that in online taxi service that adopts sharing economy platform, public can join to be a driver easily as far as he owns the vehicle. So, there are large number of vehicles are in the online taxi service. This condition is different to the existing conventional taxi that is operated by private company and the vehicles are owned by the taxi company. Even the taxi company is a big corporate, it still cannot compete with the online taxi service. The answer is developing collaboration between taxi companies so that the service is operated by a single system. Unfortunately, creating collaboration system among taxi companies is not easy. It is because the number of fleets that are owned between companies is various. The other problem is that each company has its own pricing strategy. In this research, we propose the dispatch model for conventional taxi collaboration system. Parameters in this model are travel cost, pickup distance, vehicle\u2019s idle time, and the fleet size.

In this paper, the semi-implicit staggered scheme for approximating the shallow water-Exner model will be elaborated to describe the erodible sediment on a steep slope. This scheme is known as a robust scheme to approximate shallow water-Exner model. The results are shown in a good agreement with the experimental data.

As Root CA in INPKI, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) shall propose CP and CPS for itself and also provide CP and CPS framework for its Sub-CAs. Previously, Sub-CAs confronts difficulties to propose CP and CPS due to their low proficiency. Using the concept of knowledge management, MCIT needs to regulate and educate Sub-CAs and itself as Root CA by proposing CP and CPS as knowledge transfer and guidelines. Proposed CP and CPS become empirical externalization and internalization so that each CA can compose its own CP and CPS with decent content to cover the required issues. This research explores how CAs in INPKI formulates their CP and CPS based on Request for Comment (RFC) 3647 with larger point of view. This exploration aims to extend and criticize whether the proposed CP and CPS are qualified to encourage the CA\u2019s readiness and the preparation of INPKI. This exploration contributes significant impact through preparation of CP and CPS. Produced CP and CPS will be more qualified and enhanced in unveiling necessary information to obtain trustworthiness in three aspects: governance; technical; and human resource requirements. \u00a9 2005 \u2013 ongoing JATIT & LLS."

In order to overcome some of these problems, a compact quad-wide fractional bandwidth (QW-BPF) using stub step impedance resonator with meandering structure is proposed, designed and analyzed in this paper. The proposed resonator is constructed by dual-stub step impedance resonator (DS-SIR) to produce several transmission zeros with four wide passbands and good transmission coefficients.

Developing service oriented software in service computing terminology used service composition as its main method. Service composition is affected by service computing concepts and computing technology. The development of computing technology drives the changes in traditional service composition so that not only provides composite services according to requests from users, but must be able to meet the latest computing technology.. The latest computing technology that influences the service composition namely mobile computing, cloud computing, big data, and social computing. Today, mobile computing and cloud computing are the computing technologies that are closest to users. This paper analyzes the results of research to create services on the cellular and cloud computing domains that have been published in 2015-2018. The results of the study were then identified to find opportunities for service composition research on the two computational technologies in question. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."

P-V curve changed by the rapid changing of irradiation level and temperature. In this curve, there is a point that produce highest rate of power harvesting, its called Maximum Power Point (MPP). The MPP Tracking is technique to track the MPP, so the system will run in optimal mode. In the other side, the partial shading to PV surface will cause more than one MPP, even though only one MPP that produce highest rate of output power. It is called global MPP, the other is local MPP. This article shows the genetic algorithm (GA) which is implemented in MPPT technique as a meta-heuristic search. The GA implemented in a DC\/DC buck converter with the STM32 F4 microcontroller to run the algorithm and control the converter as real-time. The GA performance is compared to the PO's by their system efficiency, power output, and tracking time. The experimental treatment done by a single tracking cycle and a single solar daily cycle in the roof of Herman Yohanes Building, Universitas Gadjah Mada. The test conducted for single solar daily cycle, shows that GA implementation on MPPT has 91% efficiency (in average) and PO implementation on MPPT has 89% efficiency (in average).

            "Introduction: Chili and tomato are a type of fruit vegetable plant that is very often consumed by Indonesians in their daily diet. Fluctuating commodity prices are causing anxiety among consumers, especially farmers. The price of these commodities, especially chilies, has become a major concern for the Indonesian government. Price changes occur due to several factors: product quality, market demand, and production costs. The quality of the product is determined by the growth process of the commodity. If the selling price is influenced by product quality and product quality is influenced by weather, then there is an indirect correlation between price and weather. Material and Method: In this study, the selling price of chilies and tomatoes was predicted using a modified Artificial Neural Network algorithm, optimized by a Nested Genetic algorithm. Results: The results were then classified to obtain economic price and planting recommendations. The price is said to be economic in value if the selling price is greater than the cost of production. Farmers can use planting recommendations to decide the right planting period, so that there is no harvest failure. In addition, using this information, farmers will not suffer from losses due to selling prices that cannot cover production costs. Conclusion: The results obtained from this experiment show that there is a match of the values of economic price and planting date recommendation for chilies and tomatoes, with an accuracy of 81% and 100%, respectively. \u00a9 2018 Nhita et al.",

            "Web-based learning environment has led to the creation of a big number of digital learning materials that offers various topics. Learners spend much time for browsing and filtering information that suits their needs. Limited time can prevent learners from finding useful learning materials. One of the most successful such technique to solve the problem is recommender system which can select items the user is interested in from a large amount of data. Previous research has attempted to use content-based filtering combined with good learners' ratings method (CBF-GL method). This research proposes an improved method for an existing e-learning recommender system with combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering with good learners' ratings (CBF-CF-GL method). Adding a collaborative filtering method intended that only ratings from good learners with certain similarity with the active learner are used in rating recommendations. Experiments were conducted for measuring and comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores of CBF-CF-GL and CBF-GL methods using the same dataset. The experiment shows that the CBF-GL method has produced a MAE score of 0.542, while the CBF-CF-GL method has given a MAE score of 0.447. It has shown that the inclusion of collaborative filtering considering good learners' ratings has improved the recommendation accuracy. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.",

            "Web-based learning environment has led to the creation of a big number of digital learning materials that offers various topics. Learners spend much time for browsing and filtering information that suits their needs. Limited time can prevent learners from finding useful learning materials. One of the most successful such technique to solve the problem is recommender system which can select items the user is interested in from a large amount of data.

Based on a theory which states that learning can be acquired through imitation of competent models, we observed and analyzed the exercises completed by good learners to predict an appropriate sequence of questions for the students to follow. We applied the Hidden Markov Model to represent students' skills and the generative Markov Decision Process to model the exercise experience of good learners. The resulting model represents recommendations of dynamic sequences of questions. A preliminary study has been conducted to elicit a real-world dataset of a programming course. It aims to measure the reliability of the proposed approach, in comparison with the conventional approach where teachers determined the questions. The approach performance is indicated by increased percentages of good learners. The experiment results show that the proposed approach has a better reliability than the conventional approach. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Semantic similarity examines the degree of likeness and shared common properties of two concepts. For example, the Quranic concept of Allah and God will result in a high score of semantic similarity, whereas hell and paradise will yield in a low score because of its extremely different attributes and semantic features. Apart from that, we also delivered the Quranic concept semantic similarity standard dataset which consists of some pairs of Quranic concept along with its similarity score, which was manually annotated by human raters. This dataset resulted in the score of inter-annotator agreement 0.63, not far from the the ones yielded by some well-known datasets such as WordSim and Simlex. Furthermore, to measure the semantic similarity score, we chose the knowledge-based approach by utilizing lexical database properties such as the length and depth of a synonym set (synset). We then applied it to Yuhua Li equation, which has been considered to be the baseline among researchers within the problem of semantic similarity. In terms of the result, our system gained Pearson's correlation 0.33 and Spearman's 0.19. By considering inter-annotator agreement 0.63 that our Quranic standard dataset has as the upper bound score, there are still quite large room for improvement to better mimicking Muslim's intuition to measure the degree of similarity of concepts within the domain of Quran. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Biodiesel is defined as methyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats or similar which conform to ASTM D6751 specifications for use in diesel engines. However, low temperature combustion mode has attracted widespread attention in particulate matter and NOx emissions reduction simultaneously. Thus, this paper evaluates the potential of using algae as the alternative fuel for diesel engines and focuses on experimental investigation for the influence of ambient temperature on ignition delay and emission with different types of biodiesel. A Rapid Compression Machine (RCM) is used for simulated the diesel combustion as similar in the real diesel engine. Besides, two types of biodiesel blends, B2 (2vol%) such as Algae and Jatropha biodiesel were tested on RCM at injection pressure of 130 MPa under different ambient temperatures from 750 K to 1100 K. The experimental results were compared with Palm-Oil biodiesel with blending ratio of 5vol%, 10vol% and 15vol%. Nevertheless, the result indicated that the ignition delay is slowed when ambient temperature is increased. These phenomena can be explained by the thermal properties of fuels. Ignition delay is found to be slower if premixed combustion process is reduced and also higher ambient temperature due to the increased in fuel ignitibility. The emission of NOx increased as the ambient temperature increased to cause highly combustion temperature. \u00a9 Penerbit UTHM.",

Currently, the collection of evidence of motor vehicle accidents by the authorities has not included data on the condition of the vehicle before the occurrence of the accident. Unlike an aircraft accident investigation that includes aircraft condition data derived from various sensors recorded in Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The recording data in FDR can be the evidence of the accident and it is expected to add to the accuracy of an accident investigation. Car Data Recorder Prototype is a system capable of recording the condition of four-wheeled vehicles and notify if there has been an accident. Vehicle condition recording utilizes Onboard Diagnostic-II (OBD-II) feature with parameter recording: gas pedal position, engine speed, vehicle speed, and engine temperature. Accident detection utilizes the ADXL345 accelerometer sensor and the condition of open or non-open airbag vehicles monitored by Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). If there is an indication of an accident, notification in the form of SMS will be sent by using GSM SIM800L module. Testing the data recording feature prototype car data recorder performed on city car is able to take advantage of features OBD-II to record the parameters that have been determined. Recorded data is processed into graphical information showing the position of the gas pedal, engine speed, vehicle speed, and engine temperature within a specified time range. There is a 5-second delay in recording data of engine speed and speed of the vehicle, but the data pattern of recording engine rotation is identical with 84.8% accuracy while the data of vehicle speed recording is also synonymous with 74.4% accuracy. Based on the accident simulation results, the ADXL345 and DTC accelerometer can detect frontal collisions and airbag conditions, which triggers GSM SIM800L to send SMS notification. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The recording data in FDR can be the evidence of the accident and it is expected to add to the accuracy of an accident investigation. Car Data Recorder Prototype is a system capable of recording the condition of four-wheeled vehicles and notify if there has been an accident. Vehicle condition recording utilizes Onboard Diagnostic-II (OBD-II) feature with parameter recording: gas pedal position, engine speed, vehicle speed, and engine temperature. Accident detection utilizes the ADXL345 accelerometer sensor and the condition of open or non-open airbag vehicles monitored by Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). If there is an indication of an accident, notification in the form of SMS will be sent by using GSM SIM800L module. Testing the data recording feature prototype car data recorder performed on city car is able to take advantage of features OBD-II to record the parameters that have been determined. Recorded data is processed into graphical information showing the position of the gas pedal, engine speed, vehicle speed, and engine temperature within a specified time range. There is a 5-second delay in recording data of engine speed and speed of the vehicle, but the data pattern of recording engine rotation is identical with 84.8% accuracy while the data of vehicle speed recording is also synonymous with 74.4% accuracy. Based on the accident simulation results, the ADXL345 and DTC accelerometer can detect frontal collisions and airbag conditions, which triggers GSM SIM800L to send SMS notification. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."

Several of hand gesture recognition methods still have the same problem when trying to recognize hand gesture accurately because of the existence of the uncontrolled environment problem, especially complex background. This study offered a method that can handle complex background in hand gesture recognition by analyzing pattern in spatio temporal domain. The system could reduce irregular noise in complex background significantly that affected to recognize the hand gesture.

A Relative Tolerance Relation of Rough Set (RTRS) for potential fish yields in Indonesia. In: Ashraf, M.A., and Chowdhury, A.J.K. (eds.), Coastal Ecosystem Responses to Human and Climatic Changes throughout Asia. The sea is essential to life on earth, including regulating the climate, producing oxygen, providing medicines, providing habitats for marine animals, and feeding millions of people. It must be ensured that the sea continues to meet the needs of life without sacrificing the people of future generations. The sea regulates the planet's climate and is a significant source of nutrients. The sea becomes an essential part of global commerce, while the contents of the ocean become the solution of human energy needs today and the future. The wealth and potential of the sea as a source of energy for humans today and the future needs to be mapped and described to provide a picture of marine potential to all concerned. As part of the government, the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries is responsible for the process of formulating, determining, and implementing policies in the field of marine and fisheries based on the results of mapping and extracting information from existing conditions. The results of this information can be used to predict the marine potential in a marine area. This prediction process can be developed using data-mining techniques such as applying the association rule by looking at the relationship between the quantity of fish based on the plankton abundance index. However, this association rules data-mining techniques that require complete data, which are data sets with no missing values to generate interesting rules for detection systems. The problem is often that required marine data are not available or that marine data are available, but they contain incomplete data. To address this problem, this paper introduces a Relative Tolerance Relation of Rough Set (RTRS). Novelty RTRS differs from previous rough approaches that use tolerance relationships, nonsymmetric equation relationships, and limited tolerance relationships. The RTRS approach is based on a limited tolerance relationship considering the relative precision between two objects; therefore, this is the first job to use relative precision. In addition, this paper presents the mathematical approach of the RTRS and compares it with other existing approaches using the marine real dataset to classify the marine potential level of the region. The results show that the proposed approach is better than the existing approach in terms of accuracy. \u00a9 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2018.",

To overcome these issues, we propose a relative tolerance relation of rough set (RTRS) to handling incomplete information systems, which it has flexibility and precisely for data classification.

Therefore, estimated state of charge value, in respect to loaded battery voltage, would increase slower on VM < 11:64 volts and faster on other range. \u00a9 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science."

In this paper, a non-contacting sensor for monitoring small displacement or vibration based on measurement of antenna reflection coefficient is proposed. A theoretical and numerical study is performed to investigate the proposed method and to determine the post processing method associated with the antenna reflection coefficient data. To avoid the ambiguity in the measured data, the detection of both the magnitude and phase components of the antenna reflection coefficient is required to compute the small displacement of the target. The distance between antenna and target has to be determined in order to minimize the ambiguity range in the data. The frequency domain observation is more appropriate for determining the amplitude and frequency of the target vibration. Magnitude detection, phase detection and Fourier analysis are used as main tools in the post-processing part of the proposed method. \u00a9 2018, Electromagnetics Academy. All rights reserved.",

The problem does not rest in the invention part or the generation of innovative ideas, but more in the profitable management of the innovation process from an approach to a successful product in the market. This paper puts forward a comparative study of customer-oriented innovation process model Blank, Ries, and Maurya. This paper quarry is the most appropriate model and best fit with startups samples, and looking for rational reasons to do further research to obtain the innovation process model that more appropriate and specific to startups. This research used an explanatory sequential research design in which qualitative and quantitative studies. These data were gathered from 5 startups in Indonesia through FGD, interviews, and observations. Substantial evidence supports that model Maurya is the most appropriate model and best fit with these startups and additional research is needed to formulate a new model that fully supports creative ecosystem industry in Indonesia. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

Finding an effective channel composition in a BCI system is important for parsing the complexity of these systems. In this study, several statistical methods based on an energy extraction method were used to automatically detect the composition of selected channels. We introduce four techniques for automatic channel selection to optimize the energy extraction method, such as mean, high mean, box, and high in box. The performance of all of the proposed techniques was evaluated based on performance accuracy, compression ratio, and channel mapping on a brain scalp. The performance of the proposed BCI framework was compared against a BCI framework that used a manual technique as the energy extraction method. The proposed BCI framework system used a conventional common spatial pattern (CSP) to extract features from two-class motor imagery EEG signals before employing extreme learning machine (ELM) to classify the features of the EEG signal. As a result, the proposed automatic channel selection methods were found effective in finding optimal channels and provided better performance accuracy. In general, the proposed method improved the conventional BCI performance by up to 16% accuracy and 87% channel compression size. Besides that, the automatic technique also yielded better BCI performance accuracy of up to 5% compared to the BCI system that used the manual technique of energy extraction as its EEG channel selection method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The bad behavior is partly caused by the low level of passenger occupancy. The drivers try to search for passengers as much as possible but often ignore the traffic rules. To overcome this problem, an optimal transport route with high passenger potential is required. Therefore, this study investigated the optimal route of city transport based on the passenger occupancy rate in the city of Bandung as the case study. The method employed for determining the optimal route is Genetic algorithm combined with Ordinary Kriging method used for the process of passenger prediction and fitness calculation. The optimal routes are those with higher occupancy rate.

This study proposed a method for detecting and counting the number of mangos in occluded conditions by evaluating the color filter and identifying the specific characteristics of fruit such as the homogeneity of fruit surface. This study fully made use of the information extracted from the created blobs after conducting histogram filtering such as blob weighting, evaluating the blob gradient topography and performing a hierarchical clustering. This method had a lower efficiency cost and did not need to determine the number of clusters to be searched. The function of this method was also improved by providing the information of the position and the number of fruits in the result images. This information could be used to make a precise detection. The images used in this experiment were 150 mango images divided into 30 training images and 120 testing images.

Large earthquake is occur in 2004 and large GPS data is only available from Sumatra GPS Array (SuGAr). This study is intended to support ionospheric tomography for limited data by checkerboard test. Tomography result is obtained by optimizing grid size, interval, a priori models, and norm damping. The dependency to a priori model is reduce by choosing alpha value parameter (\u03b1 = 0.1). For case study, ionospheric tomography is implemented to preseismic analysis in Bengkulu earthquake at September 12, 2007 which expected to have long-term effects in the ionosphere. The result is validated by checkerboard test to shows the resolutions of ionospheric tomography. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

For examples if we input query \"causing fire hazard\", then the computer has to recognize this query that this query has same meaning as \"the cause of fire hazard. Paraphrasing is an activity that reveals the meaning of an expression, writing, or speech using different words or forms, especially to achieve greater clarity. In this research we will focus on classifying two Indonesian sentences whether it is a paraphrase to each other or not. There are four steps in this research, first is preprocessing, second is feature extraction, third is classifier building, and the last is performance evaluation. Preprocessing consists of tokenization, non-alphanumerical removal, and stemming. After preprocessing we will conduct feature extraction in order to build new features from given dataset. There are two kinds of features in the research, syntactic features and semantic features. Syntactic features consist of normalized levenshtein distance feature, term-frequency based cosine similarity feature, and LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) feature. Semantic features consist of Wu and Palmer feature and Shortest Path Feature. We use Bayesian Networks as the method of training the classifier. Parameter estimation that we use is called MAP (Maximum A Posteriori). For structure learning of Bayesian Networks DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), we use BDeu (Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform) scoring function and for finding DAG with the best BDeu score, we use K2 algorithm. In evaluation step we perform cross-validation.

            "At the moment, there are two main methods of solving the compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction problem which are the convex optimization and the greedy algorithm. Convex optimization has good reconstruction stability but very slow in computation. Greedy algorithm, on the other hand, is very fast but less stable. A fast and stable CS reconstruction algorithm is necessary for a better provision of CS in practical application. In this paper we proposed a CS reconstruction algorithm using L1-norm minimization via L2-norm minimization. This method is based on geometrical interpretation of L1-norm minimization of the reconstruction problem and the fact that the Euclidean distance between L1-norm and L2-norm solution lie closely. In other word, if L2-norm solution is found, then direction to the L1-norm solution is on the shortest path connecting them. This approach offers a simpler computation. Computer simulation showed that proposed algorithm has better stability than the greedy algorithm and faster computation than the convex optimization. The proposed algorithm thus provides an alternative solution for CS reconstruction problem when a balance between speed and stability is required. \u00a9 2018, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

Based on the simulation, angkot still have potential opportunity to compete with online motorcycle taxi because the price is cheaper than online motorcycle taxi even it needs to exchange angkot. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."

Based on the simulation, angkot still have potential opportunity to compete with online motorcycle taxi because the price is cheaper than online motorcycle taxi even it needs to exchange angkot. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."

In general, a Muslim consumer must pay attention to the selected products in order to avoid neither things that are forbidden by Allah nor excessive behavior. Meanwhile, the trend of online shopping in Indonesia tends to increase every year. It definitely affects the former shopping behavior from direct visit to the store into indirect transaction through online shops via the internet. Muslim consumers are starting to buy products from online shops or e-commerce. In fact, Muslim consumers find problem in finding information about halal product, especially for processed meat and imported products. In addition, they also rarely have access to bargain price given in e-commerce sellers. In some e-commerce providers, several products also contain pork and alcohol, which are obviously prohibited by Islamic law. The existence of credit card payment methods also contains usury (riba).

Molecules are attracted to each other by bond. This paper is presented to disclose the relationship between weight and connectivity of nodes with biased random walk. An equation of biased random walk which named as significant directed random walk is formed to enhance the connectivity of nodes in directed graph via weigh. To be completely biased to the random walk, references data is implement as directed graph. Weight of genes will be used as one of the parameter in the formula. While the adjacency matrix is further enhanced by Warshall's algorithm to increases the accessibility of nodes via vector. The evolution of random walk is disclosed in this paper as well. Significant directed random walk will be used to prove the importance of weight in this paper. Comparison of the result between biased random walk is presented to prove the enhancement of random walk. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."

We present an implementation of Cheney\u2019s garbage collector in the graph programming language GP 2 and a proof that it is totally correct. Our proof is shorter and less complicated than comparable proofs in the literature. This is partly due to the fact that the GP 2 program abstracts from details of memory management such as address arithmetic.

Currently, the collection of evidence of motor vehicle accidents by the authorities has not included data on the condition of the vehicle before the occurrence of the accident. Unlike an aircraft accident investigation that includes aircraft condition data derived from various sensors recorded in Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The recording data in FDR can be the evidence of the accident and it is expected to add to the accuracy of an accident investigation. Car Data Recorder Prototype is a system capable of recording the condition of four-wheeled vehicles and notify if there has been an accident. Vehicle condition recording utilizes Onboard Diagnostic-II (OBD-II) feature with parameter recording: gas pedal position, engine speed, vehicle speed, and engine temperature. Accident detection utilizes the ADXL345 accelerometer sensor and the condition of open or non-open airbag vehicles monitored by Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC). If there is an indication of an accident, notification in the form of SMS will be sent by using GSM SIM800L module. Testing the data recording feature prototype car data recorder performed on city car is able to take advantage of features OBD-II to record the parameters that have been determined. Recorded data is processed into graphical information showing the position of the gas pedal, engine speed, vehicle speed, and engine temperature within a specified time range. There is a 5-second delay in recording data of engine speed and speed of the vehicle, but the data pattern of recording engine rotation is identical with 84.8% accuracy while the data of vehicle speed recording is also synonymous with 74.4% accuracy.

            "A concept of trained neurons-based motion detection (TNMD) in optical camera communications (OCC) is proposed. The proposed TNMD is based on neurons present in a neural network that perform repetitive analysis in order to provide efficient and reliable motion detection in OCC. This efficient motion detection can be considered another functionality of OCC in addition to two traditional functionalities of illumination and communication. To verify the proposed TNMD, the experiments were conducted in an indoor static downlink OCC, where a mobile phone front camera is employed as the receiver and an 8 \u00d7 8 red, green, and blue (RGB) light-emitting diode array as the transmitter. The motion is detected by observing the user's finger movement in the form of centroid through the OCC link via a camera. Unlike conventional trained neurons approaches, the proposed TNMD is trained not with motion itself but with centroid data samples, thus providing more accurate detection and far less complex detection algorithm. The experiment results demonstrate that the TNMD can detect all considered motions accurately with acceptable bit error rate (BER) performances at a transmission distance of up to 175 cm. In addition, while the TNMD is performed, a maximum data rate of 3.759 kbps over the OCC link is obtained. The OCC with the proposed TNMD combined can be considered an efficient indoor OCC system that provides illumination, communication, and motion detection in a convenient smart home environment. \u00a9 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",

These points make online transportation have advantages over the existing conventional transportation service. Online transportation service is an example of disruptive technology that change the relationship between customers and companies. In Indonesia, there are high competition among online transportation provider, hence the companies must maintain and monitor their service level. To understand their position, we apply both sentiment analysis and multiclass classification to understand customer opinions. From negative sentiments, we can identify problems and establish problem-solving priorities. As a case study, we use the most popular online transportation provider in Indonesia: Gojek and Grab. Since many customers are actively give compliment and complain about company's service level on Twitter, therefore we collect 61,721 tweets in Bahasa during one month observations. We apply Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine methods to see which model perform best for our data. The result reveal Gojek has better service quality with 19.76% positive and 80.23% negative sentiments than Grab with 9.2% positive and 90.8% negative. The Gojek highest problem-solving priority is regarding application problems, while Grab is about unusable promos.

            "Online transportation service is known for its accessibility, transparency, and tariff affordability. These points make online transportation have advantages over the existing conventional transportation service. Online transportation service is an example of disruptive technology that change the relationship between customers and companies. In Indonesia, there are high competition among online transportation provider, hence the companies must maintain and monitor their service level. To understand their position, we apply both sentiment analysis and multiclass classification to understand customer opinions. From negative sentiments, we can identify problems and establish problem-solving priorities. As a case study, we use the most popular online transportation provider in Indonesia: Gojek and Grab. Since many customers are actively give compliment and complain about company's service level on Twitter, therefore we collect 61,721 tweets in Bahasa during one month observations. We apply Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine methods to see which model perform best for our data. The result reveal Gojek has better service quality with 19.76% positive and 80.23% negative sentiments than Grab with 9.2% positive and 90.8% negative. The Gojek highest problem-solving priority is regarding application problems, while Grab is about unusable promos. The overall result shows general problems of both case study are related to accessibility dimension which indicate lack of capability to provide good digital access to the end users. \u00a9 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

The LWT process produces several subbands of an audio. After selecting a lower frequency of audio subband, the selected subband is transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain by DCT. Each frame of the DCT coefficients is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix and a triangular matrix by QR. Using QIM, a watermark is inserted into triangular matrix by quantizing the data to a value corresponding to the quantizer contained in the watermark. In the audio watermarking experiment, we obtain robust and imperceptible watermarking with very high watermark payload.

            "The wireless power transfer via an electro-magnetic (EM) wave enables far-field power transfer for supplying power to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the power attenuation of the EM wave leads to low end-to-end power transfer efficiency. In this paper, we provide an analytic and experimental study on the distributed wireless power transfer system as a means to overcome the low power transfer efficiency. In the distributed wireless power transfer system, a number of multiantenna power beacons, which are distributed over space, send out wireless power to charge IoT devices. Since each power beacon has a separate local oscillator and controller, it is very challenging to achieve frequency and phase synchronization among power beacons, which is the prerequisite for optimal distributed beamforming. In this paper, we study the performance of the distributed wireless power transfer system with or without the frequency and phase synchronization. Based on the experiment and simulation results, we show that the distributed wireless charging is advantageous in terms of the coverage probability as long as the optimal distributed beamforming is available in the distributed wireless power transfer system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This has resulted in imports of 100,000 tons of cacao in 2014. Such an issue happens due to many factors, for instance fluctuation of cacao prices, low farmer income and land conversion. The cause of land conversion is that cacao crops are no longer attractive to farmers, thus many of them are turning to other commodities. The objective of this research is to analyze the basic needs of farmers in order to determine the optimal quantities that farmers should supply. The methodology adopted for the research is Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) to determine the basic needs of farmers in the cacao supply activities.

However, most existing MAS engineering methodologies do not fully support self-organizing systems design since they require predefined goals and agent behaviors, which is not the case in self-organizing systems. Another feature that is currently not supported for designing self-organizing MAS is the separation between the design of agent behaviors and behavior adaptation, i.e. how agents adapt their behaviors to respond upon changes. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a role modeling method, in which agent behaviors are represented as roles, to design how agents perform behavior adaptation at runtime by switching between roles.

            "Ecology is a branch of biology that studies the interaction and relationship between organisms and their environment. Abundance, distribution of organisms and patterns of biodiversity are great interests for many ecologists. One of interesting ecosystems to be studied is a cave. A cave has a typical environment character with a vulnerable ecosystem. Many caves in Indonesia, particularly in Gunungsewu karst area have been developed into tourist objects (show caves) and managed imprudently. Such cave management has potential to harm the environment and leads to ecosystem destruction. Arthropods are the most abundance fauna in cave that play critical roles in maintaining cave ecosystems equilibrium.

            "Ecology is a branch of biology that studies the interaction and relationship between organisms and their environment. Abundance, distribution of organisms and patterns of biodiversity are great interests for many ecologists. One of interesting ecosystems to be studied is a cave. A cave has a typical environment character with a vulnerable ecosystem. Many caves in Indonesia, particularly in Gunungsewu karst area have been developed into tourist objects (show caves) and managed imprudently. Such cave management has potential to harm the environment and leads to ecosystem destruction. Arthropods are the most abundance fauna in cave that play critical roles in maintaining cave ecosystems equilibrium.

The purposes of this study are to determine the best alternative to be carried out by Astra Credit Companies when analyzed using BATNA in open ascending and sealed highest bid auctions, and to know the price range and condition class of the auction unit that allows for an agreement to take place when analyzed using ZOPA.

In this paper, we have designed audio watermarking based on Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) with Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), QR Decomposition (QR). The LWT process produces several subbands of an audio. After selecting a lower frequency of audio subband, the selected subband is transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain by DCT. Each frame of the DCT coefficients is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix and a triangular matrix by QR. Using QIM, a watermark is inserted into triangular matrix by quantizing the data to a value corresponding to the quantizer contained in the watermark. In the audio watermarking experiment, we obtain robust and imperceptible watermarking with very high watermark payload.

A trust-based security system is a promising solution in IoT as it is suitable for the characteristic of IoT which is distributed, decentralized control and on-off connections. Knowing the behaviors of the attacks might help up to understand of how we may prevent the attacks and plan to mitigate the attacks. In this paper, we simulated trust-based attacks in IoT environment by giving the fake reputation values of an object. For this purpose, we utilized ConTrust model, a trust-based security model. Matlab was used to simulate the attacks, and the simulation result showed that ConTrust model was outperformed on mitigating a trust-based attack. The attack was detected and resolved correctly. \u00a9 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018."

Paraphrasing is an activity that reveals the meaning of an expression, writing, or speech using different words or forms, especially to achieve greater clarity. In this research we will focus on classifying two Indonesian sentences whether it is a paraphrase to each other or not.

Preprocessing consists of tokenization, non-alphanumerical removal, and stemming. After preprocessing we will conduct feature extraction in order to build new features from given dataset. There are two kinds of features in the research, syntactic features and semantic features. Syntactic features consist of normalized levenshtein distance feature, term-frequency based cosine similarity feature, and LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) feature. Semantic features consist of Wu and Palmer feature and Shortest Path Feature. We use Bayesian Networks as the method of training the classifier.

This study aims to investigate the redox potential of iron-sulfur proteins with [2Fe-2S] core by using two typical exchange-correlation functionals in density functional theory (DFT), i.e., B3LYP and M06, with and without the diffuse function. Since it involves transition metals, several types of spin approximation were also explored, such as high spin (HS), low spin (LS), approximated spin projection (AP), and J coupling parameter (JC) methods. We found that the diffuse function contributes to improving the accuracy. We also found that M06 functional produced more accurate results than B3LYP.

The range of redox potentials of these proteins are so wide that many substrates can interact with them. Thus, the redox potentials of the iron-sulfur proteins are crucial to facilitate the process. This study aims to investigate the redox potential of iron-sulfur proteins with [2Fe-2S] core by using two typical exchange-correlation functionals in density functional theory (DFT), i.e., B3LYP and M06, with and without the diffuse function. Since it involves transition metals, several types of spin approximation were also explored, such as high spin (HS), low spin (LS), approximated spin projection (AP), and J coupling parameter (JC) methods. We found that the diffuse function contributes to improving the accuracy. We also found that M06 functional produced more accurate results than B3LYP. The best result is obtained for AP UM06\/ 6-31++G(d,p) with the absolute error of 0.01V. \u00a9 2018 The Chemical Society of Japan."

In this study, we tested the degree of self-similarity of pulmonary crackle sound and examined whether the degree of similarity can be used as a feature to differentiate the pulmonary lung crackle sound with normal lung sound. The results showed the sufficient strength of the self-similarity nature of the pulmonary crackle sound. Meanwhile, a test using K-mean clustering produced an accuracy of 87.5% to differentiate between the pulmonary crackle sound and normal lung sound.

The LWT process produces several subbands of an audio. After selecting a lower frequency of audio subband, the selected subband is transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain by DCT. Each frame of the DCT coefficients is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix and a triangular matrix by QR. Using QIM, a watermark is inserted into triangular matrix by quantizing the data to a value corresponding to the quantizer contained in the watermark. In the audio watermarking experiment, we obtain robust and imperceptible watermarking with very high watermark payload.

The purposes of this study are to determine the best alternative to be carried out by Astra Credit Companies when analyzed using BATNA in open ascending and sealed highest bid auctions, and to know the price range and condition class of the auction unit that allows for an agreement to take place when analyzed using ZOPA.

            "Nowadays, conventional taxi business meets strong competition with the online taxi service. One of the problem is that in online taxi service that adopts sharing economy platform, public can join to be a driver easily as far as he owns the vehicle. So, there are large number of vehicles are in the online taxi service. This condition is different to the existing conventional taxi that is operated by private company and the vehicles are owned by the taxi company. Even the taxi company is a big corporate, it still cannot compete with the online taxi service. The answer is developing collaboration between taxi companies so that the service is operated by a single system. Unfortunately, creating collaboration system among taxi companies is not easy. It is because the number of fleets that are owned between companies is various. The other problem is that each company has its own pricing strategy. In this research, we propose the dispatch model for conventional taxi collaboration system. Parameters in this model are travel cost, pickup distance, vehicle\u2019s idle time, and the fleet size. In this research, we propose three models. In the first model, order will be allocated to the vehicle that offers the lowest travel cost and has longest idle time. In the second model, order will be allocated to the vehicle that offers the lowest travel cost but the model does not guarantee that longer idle time vehicle will be preferred. In the third model, the order will be allocated to the vehicle that has the highest aggregate score of travel cost, pickup distance, idle time, and fleet size. Based on the simulation result, the first and the second models has advantage in offering the lowest travel cost while the third model has advantage in keeping pickup ratio at maximum level. \u00a9 2005 \u2013 ongoing JATIT & LLS.",

Indonesia is the country with the highest case of dengue in Southeast Asia. In addition to mosquitoes as vectors and humans as hosts, other environmental and social factors are also the cause of widespread dengue fever. To prevent the occurrence of the epidemic of the disease, fast and accurate action is required. Rapid and accurate action can be taken, if there is appropriate information support on the occurrence of the epidemic. Therefore, a complete and accurate information on the spread pattern of endemic areas is necessary, so that precautions can be done as early as possible. The information on dispersal patterns can be obtained by various methods, which are based on empirical and theoretical considerations. One of the methods used is based on the estimated number of infected patients in a region based on spatial and time. The first step of this research is conducted by predicting the number of DHF patients in 2016 until 2018 based on 2010 to 2015 data using GSTAR (1, 1). In the second phase, the distribution pattern prediction of dengue disease area is conducted. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of DHF epidemic trends, i.e. down, stable or rising, the analysis of distribution patterns of dengue fever distribution areas with IDW and Kriging (ordinary and universal Kriging) were conducted in this study. The difference between IDW and Kriging, is the initial process that underlies the prediction process. Based on the experimental results, it is known that the dispersion pattern of epidemic areas of dengue disease with IDW and Ordinary Kriging is similar in the period of time. \u00a9 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The channel information feedback used on prior power loading is just a channel gain, so in our method, channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) feedback is a complex quantity. The magnitude of the channel is used to adjust the power allocation of each subcarrier, while the information on the channel phase is used to adjust the phase shifting. Our proposed method uses the principle of channel equalization but we apply in the transmitter.

Next, to get curves that state the quality of the system, we do simulations with the help of computing software. From the simulation results, when the CSIT works perfectly, the resulting performance in terms of the probability of error is equal to the system passing through the AWGN channel, which means the maximum power savings. Although CSIT is not perfect but can still get power savings on the transmitter side. The more accurate CSIT, the greater the power saving is obtained.

The discussion relies on recent two decades' Sea Surface Height (SSH) from two offshore points of observation in the west of Java Sea and Water Level (WL) from a tide station in Tanjung Priok port of Jakarta. The dataset of SSH is obtained by satellite altimetry on 10-day basis observation, while WL is recorded on hourly basis. Residuals are extracted from SSH and WL by removing their mean values (i.e. Mean Sea Surface, Mean Sea Level) and the tide. They range within the order of sub-meters. These count already for at least one-third of the tidal amplitude in the region. To these residuals, their mean and extreme patterns are explored. The chances of positive residuals are at least tripled with respect to the negative ones.

The unit of analysis is telecommunication firm in Indonesia with management of these firms as the observation unit. The sampe taken from the population is as many as 100 respondents from Senior Leader in Indonesia telecommunication firm. The analytical approach and the solution technique that is used as the analysis tool in this research is Partial Least Square (PLS). The result of hypothesis testing shows that DC, IC, and AC affects sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) of Indonesia's incumbent telecommunication firm in digital disruption era, where IC has more dominant influence than AC and DC in increasing SCA. This research has implications for both the management of telecommunication firm in Indonesia in maintaining and improving sustainable competitive advantage in the digital disruption era, as well as the contribution to science and further research. \u00a9 IEOM Society International.",

            "The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of dynamic capabilities (DC), innovation capabilities (IC) and alliances capabilities (AC) on sustainable competitive advantage in digital disruption era for incumbent telecommunication firm in Indonesia, due to the phenomenon of incumbent companies that fail to maintain business sustainability. New entrants could bring new innovations with cheaper, simple and efficient technology. This phenomenon referred to as Disruptive Innovation. Then the incumbents have to find new ways to stay competitive. The study is conducted by cross sectional quantitative method. The unit of analysis is telecommunication firm in Indonesia with management of these firms as the observation unit. The sampe taken from the population is as many as 100 respondents from Senior Leader in Indonesia telecommunication firm. The analytical approach and the solution technique that is used as the analysis tool in this research is Partial Least Square (PLS). The result of hypothesis testing shows that DC, IC, and AC affects sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) of Indonesia's incumbent telecommunication firm in digital disruption era, where IC has more dominant influence than AC and DC in increasing SCA. This research has implications for both the management of telecommunication firm in Indonesia in maintaining and improving sustainable competitive advantage in the digital disruption era, as well as the contribution to science and further research. \u00a9 IEOM Society International."

The macroeconomic fundamental variables are money supply, interest rate, financing rate and rate of return to depositors, and conventional index. The dynamic nexus between Syariah index and macroeconomic fundamental variables is measured based on the cointegration between the variables for the period of second quarter 1999 until the fourth quarter 2017. The finding shows cointegration between the FTSE Bursa Malaysia Emas Syariah Index with the macroeconomic variables.

The macroeconomic variables influence the FTSE Bursa Malaysia Emas Syariah Index in the long-run and short-run, namely the financing rate and rate of return to depositors and conventional index. The results of this research imply that Islamic Banking System variables namely the financing rate and rate of return to depositors can play a role as capital injection to the Islamic Capital Market in the long-run and short-run.

In this paper, we propose a new method by combining the two to save transmit power. The channel information feedback used on prior power loading is just a channel gain, so in our method, channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) feedback is a complex quantity. The magnitude of the channel is used to adjust the power allocation of each subcarrier, while the information on the channel phase is used to adjust the phase shifting. Our proposed method uses the principle of channel equalization but we apply in the transmitter. The first step in our research, we derive mathematical equations in the system model to obtain the ideal quality of communication. Next, to get curves that state the quality of the system, we do simulations with the help of computing software. From the simulation results, when the CSIT works perfectly, the resulting performance in terms of the probability of error is equal to the system passing through the AWGN channel, which means the maximum power savings. Although CSIT is not perfect but can still get power savings on the transmitter side. The more accurate CSIT, the greater the power saving is obtained. For low level modulation, 70% accuracy can get maximum pawer savings.

            "One of the challenges in adaptive learning systems is to manage learner models that include learners' profiles and activities and interaction between learners and the learning tools. In the context of lifelong learning, the learner model is a user learning pattern, which can be modelled all the time based on user interaction with various sources. The main issue in lifelong learner model design is what type of information needs to be stored in the learner model and how the information granularity is involved. The type and level of information granularity of a user will determine how appropriate the pedagogical policies are to be provided by the system for a user. Lifelong learner model design should be in line with the principles of lifelong learning, namely sociality, interoperability, and scrutability. This paper discusses our research on learner model ontology for lifelong learning.

            "One of the challenges in adaptive learning systems is to manage learner models that include learners' profiles and activities and interaction between learners and the learning tools. In the context of lifelong learning, the learner model is a user learning pattern, which can be modelled all the time based on user interaction with various sources. The main issue in lifelong learner model design is what type of information needs to be stored in the learner model and how the information granularity is involved. The type and level of information granularity of a user will determine how appropriate the pedagogical policies are to be provided by the system for a user. Lifelong learner model design should be in line with the principles of lifelong learning, namely sociality, interoperability, and scrutability. This paper discusses our research on learner model ontology for lifelong learning. The goal expected to be achieved is that there is a lifelong learner model ontology to be accessed and updated by adaptive learning systems. This research classifies learners' attributes into two groups, which are static and dynamic attributes. Static attributes tend not to change or very rarely change.

The study is based on the digital disruption phenomenon, where established companies are disrupted by the new entries with the new business model that leverages digital capability. The study focuses on information, communication and technology (ICT) of the incumbent companies in developing business model innovations as the second curve in sustaining the business. The ICT industry is an important sector in the development of other industries and has a significant influence on economic growth, which currently relies on emerging markets such as Indonesia. The Indonesian ICT market has unique characteristics where innovation grows rapidly, but infrastructure lacks behind and the market is very competitive. This creates a gap between innovation opportunities and development of digital infrastructure.

Incumbent firms still have the advantage of corporate reputation and are required to develop distinctive capability. However, the study of developing business model innovations for incumbent firms in the market with a focus on corporate reputation is still limited. The current study is an empirical study using a sample of 35 Indonesian ICT firms. Smart Partial Least Square (SmartPLS) is the analytical approach and solution technique used in the study. Research findings show that the distinctive organization capability has more influence compared to corporate reputation in developing business model innovations.

Many works have been developed to solve balancing control using specific body parts movements while in a standing position. While for small disturbance have shown well, but for quite large disturbance has limited performance. In this paper, we focus on using the slight movement of a robot when quite large disturbance is applied. The robot slightly moves its position to the same direction of the disturbance. Slightly moves of the robot seems more natural with how human perform balancing when receive quite large disturbance. We implement this on our humanoid robot soccer platform. This method is to adjust the step position of the humanoid robot's leg when getting external perturbation to remain the robot in a standing condition. By reprocessing the inverted pendulum control formula, we get the relation between the angular acceleration and the step that the robot should perform. Experiments show that with this strategy our robot platform can prevent itself from falling as twice as better than before. Our method has been successfully applied in the real humanoid robot for robot soccer competition and achieve a remarkable result. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

            "This paper investigates balancing control of a humanoid robot in soccer application. Many works have been developed to solve balancing control using specific body parts movements while in a standing position. While for small disturbance have shown well, but for quite large disturbance has limited performance. In this paper, we focus on using the slight movement of a robot when quite large disturbance is applied. The robot slightly moves its position to the same direction of the disturbance. Slightly moves of the robot seems more natural with how human perform balancing when receive quite large disturbance. We implement this on our humanoid robot soccer platform. This method is to adjust the step position of the humanoid robot's leg when getting external perturbation to remain the robot in a standing condition. By reprocessing the inverted pendulum control formula, we get the relation between the angular acceleration and the step that the robot should perform. Experiments show that with this strategy our robot platform can prevent itself from falling as twice as better than before. Our method has been successfully applied in the real humanoid robot for robot soccer competition and achieve a remarkable result. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."

            "Objective: Intersection movement assist (IMA) has been recognized as one of the prominent countermeasures to reduce angle crashes at intersections, which constitute 22% of total crashes in the United States. Utilizing vehicle-based sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, IMA offers extended vision to provide early warning for an imminent crash. However, most of IMA-related research implements their methods and strategies only in simulations, test tracks, or driving simulator studies that have quite a few assumptions and limitations and hence the effectiveness evaluations reported may not be transferable or comparable. Methods: This study seeks to develop a generalized evaluation scheme that can be used not only to assess the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety at intersections but to facilitate comparisons across similar studies. The proposed evaluation scheme utilizes the concepts of traffic conflict in terms of time-to-collision (TTC) as a crash surrogate. This approach avoids the issue of having insufficient crash frequency data for system evaluation. To measure the effectiveness of IMA on reducing traffic conflicts, a relative risk is calculated for comparing the risk of with\/without using the IMA. As a proof-of-concept study, this study applied the proposed evaluation scheme and reported the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety in a field operation test (FOT). Seven test scenarios were conducted at 4 intersections, and a total of 40 participants were recruited to use the IMA for 6\u00a0months. Results: It was estimated that IMA users have 26% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 5\u00a0s and have 15% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 4\u00a0s. However, the results vary across different sites and different definitions of conflicts in terms of TTC. Conclusions: Overall, IMA is promising to effectively reduce angle crashes related to sight obstruction and has potential to reduce not only crash frequency but crash severity. \u00a9 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

To verify the proposed TNMD, the experiments were conducted in an indoor static downlink OCC, where a mobile phone front camera is employed as the receiver and an 8 \u00d7 8 red, green, and blue (RGB) light-emitting diode array as the transmitter.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the presence of culturable W. paramesenteroides in Indonesian eel intestines and provides a basic consideration of the applicability of those strains for controlling potentially pathogenic microorganisms. \u00a9 2018 Author(s)."

We design suitable deep convolutional neural networks, which are named satellite image quality assessment of deep convolutional neural networks (SIQA-DCNN) and SIQA-DCNN++. These sophisticated methods can remove various distorted satellite images in real-time remote sensing. The novelty of this method lies in the objective assessment and restoration of the deep model which understands various distorted satellite images in high- and low-resolution problems. The activation function has a lower computational time and ensures the deactivation of noise by making the mean activators close to zero. Our methods are also effective for transfer learning, which can be used to adequately investigate satellite image classification in deep satellite image quality assessment. Using Spearman\u2019s rank order correlation coefficient (SROCC) and linear correlation coefficient (LCC) evaluations, we demonstrated that our methods show better performance than other algorithms, with more than 0.90 of SROCC and LCC values compared to the full-reference and no-reference satellite image in MODIS\/Terra and USGS datasets.

            "Objective: Intersection movement assist (IMA) has been recognized as one of the prominent countermeasures to reduce angle crashes at intersections, which constitute 22% of total crashes in the United States. Utilizing vehicle-based sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, IMA offers extended vision to provide early warning for an imminent crash. However, most of IMA-related research implements their methods and strategies only in simulations, test tracks, or driving simulator studies that have quite a few assumptions and limitations and hence the effectiveness evaluations reported may not be transferable or comparable. Methods: This study seeks to develop a generalized evaluation scheme that can be used not only to assess the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety at intersections but to facilitate comparisons across similar studies. The proposed evaluation scheme utilizes the concepts of traffic conflict in terms of time-to-collision (TTC) as a crash surrogate. This approach avoids the issue of having insufficient crash frequency data for system evaluation. To measure the effectiveness of IMA on reducing traffic conflicts, a relative risk is calculated for comparing the risk of with\/without using the IMA. As a proof-of-concept study, this study applied the proposed evaluation scheme and reported the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety in a field operation test (FOT). Seven test scenarios were conducted at 4 intersections, and a total of 40 participants were recruited to use the IMA for 6\u00a0months. Results: It was estimated that IMA users have 26% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 5\u00a0s and have 15% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 4\u00a0s. However, the results vary across different sites and different definitions of conflicts in terms of TTC. Conclusions: Overall, IMA is promising to effectively reduce angle crashes related to sight obstruction and has potential to reduce not only crash frequency but crash severity. \u00a9 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Finding an effective channel composition in a BCI system is important for parsing the complexity of these systems. In this study, several statistical methods based on an energy extraction method were used to automatically detect the composition of selected channels. We introduce four techniques for automatic channel selection to optimize the energy extraction method, such as mean, high mean, box, and high in box. The performance of all of the proposed techniques was evaluated based on performance accuracy, compression ratio, and channel mapping on a brain scalp. The performance of the proposed BCI framework was compared against a BCI framework that used a manual technique as the energy extraction method. The proposed BCI framework system used a conventional common spatial pattern (CSP) to extract features from two-class motor imagery EEG signals before employing extreme learning machine (ELM) to classify the features of the EEG signal. As a result, the proposed automatic channel selection methods were found effective in finding optimal channels and provided better performance accuracy. In general, the proposed method improved the conventional BCI performance by up to 16% accuracy and 87% channel compression size.

To measure the effectiveness of IMA on reducing traffic conflicts, a relative risk is calculated for comparing the risk of with\/without using the IMA. As a proof-of-concept study, this study applied the proposed evaluation scheme and reported the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety in a field operation test (FOT). Seven test scenarios were conducted at 4 intersections, and a total of 40 participants were recruited to use the IMA for 6\u00a0months. Results: It was estimated that IMA users have 26% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 5\u00a0s and have 15% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 4\u00a0s. However, the results vary across different sites and different definitions of conflicts in terms of TTC. Conclusions: Overall, IMA is promising to effectively reduce angle crashes related to sight obstruction and has potential to reduce not only crash frequency but crash severity. \u00a9 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

            "Objective: Intersection movement assist (IMA) has been recognized as one of the prominent countermeasures to reduce angle crashes at intersections, which constitute 22% of total crashes in the United States. Utilizing vehicle-based sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, IMA offers extended vision to provide early warning for an imminent crash. However, most of IMA-related research implements their methods and strategies only in simulations, test tracks, or driving simulator studies that have quite a few assumptions and limitations and hence the effectiveness evaluations reported may not be transferable or comparable. Methods: This study seeks to develop a generalized evaluation scheme that can be used not only to assess the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety at intersections but to facilitate comparisons across similar studies. The proposed evaluation scheme utilizes the concepts of traffic conflict in terms of time-to-collision (TTC) as a crash surrogate.

Finding an effective channel composition in a BCI system is important for parsing the complexity of these systems. In this study, several statistical methods based on an energy extraction method were used to automatically detect the composition of selected channels. We introduce four techniques for automatic channel selection to optimize the energy extraction method, such as mean, high mean, box, and high in box. The performance of all of the proposed techniques was evaluated based on performance accuracy, compression ratio, and channel mapping on a brain scalp. The performance of the proposed BCI framework was compared against a BCI framework that used a manual technique as the energy extraction method. The proposed BCI framework system used a conventional common spatial pattern (CSP) to extract features from two-class motor imagery EEG signals before employing extreme learning machine (ELM) to classify the features of the EEG signal. As a result, the proposed automatic channel selection methods were found effective in finding optimal channels and provided better performance accuracy. In general, the proposed method improved the conventional BCI performance by up to 16% accuracy and 87% channel compression size. Besides that, the automatic technique also yielded better BCI performance accuracy of up to 5% compared to the BCI system that used the manual technique of energy extraction as its EEG channel selection method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

            "A concept of trained neurons-based motion detection (TNMD) in optical camera communications (OCC) is proposed. The proposed TNMD is based on neurons present in a neural network that perform repetitive analysis in order to provide efficient and reliable motion detection in OCC. This efficient motion detection can be considered another functionality of OCC in addition to two traditional functionalities of illumination and communication. To verify the proposed TNMD, the experiments were conducted in an indoor static downlink OCC, where a mobile phone front camera is employed as the receiver and an 8 \u00d7 8 red, green, and blue (RGB) light-emitting diode array as the transmitter. The motion is detected by observing the user's finger movement in the form of centroid through the OCC link via a camera. Unlike conventional trained neurons approaches, the proposed TNMD is trained not with motion itself but with centroid data samples, thus providing more accurate detection and far less complex detection algorithm. The experiment results demonstrate that the TNMD can detect all considered motions accurately with acceptable bit error rate (BER) performances at a transmission distance of up to 175 cm. In addition, while the TNMD is performed, a maximum data rate of 3.759 kbps over the OCC link is obtained. The OCC with the proposed TNMD combined can be considered an efficient indoor OCC system that provides illumination, communication, and motion detection in a convenient smart home environment. \u00a9 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",

            "A concept of trained neurons-based motion detection (TNMD) in optical camera communications (OCC) is proposed. The proposed TNMD is based on neurons present in a neural network that perform repetitive analysis in order to provide efficient and reliable motion detection in OCC. This efficient motion detection can be considered another functionality of OCC in addition to two traditional functionalities of illumination and communication. To verify the proposed TNMD, the experiments were conducted in an indoor static downlink OCC, where a mobile phone front camera is employed as the receiver and an 8 \u00d7 8 red, green, and blue (RGB) light-emitting diode array as the transmitter. The motion is detected by observing the user's finger movement in the form of centroid through the OCC link via a camera.

Lactic acid bacteria from the eel's intestinal contents were isolated using MRS agar supplemented with CaCO3. The growth inhibition of five indicator microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Streptococcus agalactiae) was measured to evaluate the antimicrobial property of isolates. We performed 16S rDNA sequence analysis to identify the selected strains. A total of twenty isolates were successfully collected, characterized morphologically, and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Measurement of growth inhibition by spectrophotometry confirmed that six of the isolate strains had broad- spectrum inhibition to all tested indicator microorganisms (98-100%). Furthermore, based on 16S rDNA sequencing, the two strains with the highest potential antimicrobial property, SI39 and SI42, had the closest relationship to Weissella paramesenteroides (99%).

These sophisticated methods can remove various distorted satellite images in real-time remote sensing. The novelty of this method lies in the objective assessment and restoration of the deep model which understands various distorted satellite images in high- and low-resolution problems. The activation function has a lower computational time and ensures the deactivation of noise by making the mean activators close to zero.

            "Nowadays, e-Marketplace such as Tokopedia, Bukalapak or Blibli plays significant role in the rise of e-Commerce in Indonesia. Unfortunately because of its free competition nature, price war cannot be avoided. In one side, this condition is good for customers. In the other side, merchant is difficult to make sustainable profit. So, long term growth for e-Commerce, especially in Indonesia cannot be guaranteed. Based on this problem in this research, we propose virtual merchant model that offer same products from joined merchants, so that, fierce competition can be avoided. In this research, rather than concerning only in price, delivery cost and stock size are also, parameters that are concerned. We propose three models: least cost model, two-step model and score based model. These models performance then will be compared to each other and with the conventional least price model. Based on the simulation data, these proposed models perform better in making equity among merchants rather than conventional least price model. The two-step model performs the best in reducing the gap. In the other side, the conventional least price model performs the worst one. Meanwhile, the least cost model and the score based model perform moderate result with the least cost model is slightly better than the score based model. \u00a9 Medwell Journals, 2018.",

            "Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that aims to expand the benefits of continously connected internet connectivity, IoT offers several benefits, including the ability to provide real-time data, perform process optimization, optimize resource usage, instant control and instant response, and many other things. While fuzzy logic is a method created and incorporated into a machine to make decision similar to human thinking and interpretation. Water treatment from water sources to clean water that suitable for use by humans requires a long process and high-quality control. One important part of the water treatment process is the selection of water input or known as canal intake. In this paper, fuzzy logic is used for decision makers system because of the flexibility and capability to process and interpret many states. The canal intake prototype system able to control canal intake using Atlas Scientific sensors by utilizing IoT communications. The sensor can measure several parameters such as Dissolveed Oxygen (DO), Temperature, pH, and Total Dissolved Oxygen (TDS). From the test results obrained the system can control the canal intake based on raw water quality accurately 100% in accordance with predetermined water standards. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."

Significant influence of transport on aerosol size distributions is commonly observed, especially for non-regional NPF events. With certain assumptions and approximations, a population balance method is proposed to examine the influence of transport on the temporal evolution of aerosol size distributions during NPF events. The method is derived from the aerosol general dynamic equation in the continuous form. Meteorological information (e.g., wind speed, wind direction, and water vapor mixing ratio) was used to complement the analysis. The NPF events observed in Southeast Tibet, Fukue Island, and urban Beijing were analyzed using the proposed method. Significant contribution of transport to the observed aerosol size distributions is found during the NPF events in both Southeast Tibet and Fukue Island. The changes in the contribution of transport have a good correlation with the changes in wind speed and direction. This correlation indicates that local mountain and valley breezes govern the observed new particles at the Southeast Tibet site. Most NPF events observed at Fukue Island are closely related to the long-range transport of aerosols and gaseous precursors due to the movement of air masses. Regional NPF events are typically observed in urban Beijing and the contribution of transport to the observed aerosol size distributions is negligible when compared to other processes such as condensational growth and coagulation scavenging. In a relatively clean atmospheric environment, the proposed method can be used to characterize the contribution of transport to particles in the size range from \u011d1\/4 10 to \u011d1\/4 50\u2009nm.

Cyberbullying through the internet is more dangerous than traditional bullying, because it can potentially amplify the humiliation to an unlimited online audience. According to UNICEF and a survey by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information, 58% of 435 adolescents do not understand about cyberbullying. Some of them might even have been the bullies, but since they did not understand about cyberbullying they could not recognise the negative effects of their bullying. The bullies may not recognise the harm of their actions, because they do not see immediate responses from their victims. Our study aimed to detect cyberbullying actors based on texts and the credibility analysis of users and notify them about the harm of cyberbullying. We collected data from Twitter. Since the data were unlabelled, we built a web-based labelling tool to classify tweets into cyberbullying and non-cyberbullying tweets. We obtained 301 cyberbullying tweets, 399 non-cyberbullying tweets, 2,053 negative words and 129 swear words from the tool. Afterwards, we applied SVM and KNN to learn about and detect cyberbullying texts. The results show that SVM results in the highest f1-score, 67%.

The Path based measurement method that proposed by Liu, Zhou and Zheng [3] has never been used in the AlQur'an domain. By using AlQur'an translation dataset in this research, the path based measurement method proposed by Liu, Zhou and Zheng [3] will be used to test this method in AlQur'an domain to obtain similarity values and to measure its correlation value. In this study the degree value is proposed to be used in modifying the path based method that proposed in previous research. Degree Value is the number of links that owned by a lcs (lowest common subsumer) node on a taxonomy. The links owned by a node on the taxonomy represent the semantic relationship that a node has in the taxonomy. By using degree value to modify the path-based method that proposed in previous research is expected that the correlation value obtained will increase. After running some experiment by using proposed method, the correlation measurement value can obtain fairly good correlation ties with 200 Word Pairs derive from Noun POS SimLex-999. The correlation value that be obtained is 93.3% which means their bonds are strong and they have very strong correlation.

            "One of the main features of The Language Grid is its support for service composition, i.e. creating new language services that meet user requirements by combining the existing ones. Despite the potential of service composition, such a service-oriented computing (SOC) application may experience cascading failure when a disruption on one or more component services is propagated to the composite services that combine them. As the number of language services grows, composite language services will become more common, and thus understanding cascading failure among language services becomes more important. This chapter investigates how failure may propagate among language services and how to improve language service tolerance to cascading failure. To this end, the dependency between language services is modeled as service network on which cascading failure is simulated and analyzed. We also generated service networks in scale-free, exponential, and random topology to analyze how cascading failure occurs in different topology. The simulation reveals that service networks with scale-free topology have better cascading-failure tolerance compares to that of other topology. \u00a9 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

In this paper, we propose synchronization of audio watermarking with Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) with combined techniques of Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), Discrete Sine Transform (DST), QR Decomposition, and Cartesian Polar Transform (CPT). Firstly, after reading host audio, we insert header using SS-based synchronization. Next, host audio is decomposed by SWT, then several subbands with average power above than threshold are selected for next process. Next, the selected subbands in time domain are transformed by DST into frequency domain. Then, the frequency domain signal is decomposed by QR decomposition. In R matrix, its coefficients at position (1, 1) and (2.2) are transformed using CPT. Finally, QIM inserts watermark bits into CPT coefficients.
